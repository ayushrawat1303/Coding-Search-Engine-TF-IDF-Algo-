Minimum Operations Make Array KIncreasing You given indexed array arr consisting positive integers positive integer array arr called Kincreasing if arr arr holds for every index where For example arr Kincreasing for because arr arr arr arr arr arr arr arr However same arr not Kincreasing for because arr arr because arr arr one operation you can choose index change arr into any positive integer Return minimum number operations required make array Kincreasing for given Example Input arr Output Explanation For resultant array has be nondecreasing Some Kincreasing arrays can be formed All them require operations It suboptimal change array for example because it would take operations It can be shown we cannot make array Kincreasing less than operations Example Input arr Output Explanation This same example as one problem description Here for every index where arr arr Since given array already Kincreasing we do not need perform any operations Example Input arr Output Explanation Indices only ones not satisfying arr arr for One ways we can make array Kincreasing by changing arr arr array will now be Note there can be other ways make array Kincreasing but none them require less than operations Constraints arrlength arr arrlength
