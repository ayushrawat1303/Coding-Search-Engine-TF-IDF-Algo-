SingleThreaded CPU You given tasks labeled from represented by integer array tasks where tasks means ith task will be available process enqueueTimei will take processingTimei finish processing You have singlethreaded CPU can process most one task time will act following way If CPU idle there no available tasks process CPU remains idle If CPU idle there available tasks CPU will choose one with shortest processing time If multiple tasks have same shortest processing time it will choose task with smallest index Once task started CPU will process entire task without stopping CPU can finish task then start new one instantly Return order which CPU will process tasks Example Input tasks Output Explanation events go as follows time task available process Available tasks Also time idle CPU starts processing task Available tasks time task available process Available tasks time task available process Available tasks Also time CPU finishes task starts processing task as it shortest Available tasks time task available process Available tasks time CPU finishes task starts processing task as it shortest Available tasks time CPU finishes task starts processing task Available tasks time CPU finishes task becomes idle Example Input tasks Output Explanation events go as follows time all tasks become available Available tasks Also time idle CPU starts processing task Available tasks time CPU finishes task starts processing task Available tasks time CPU finishes task starts processing task Available tasks time CPU finishes task starts processing task Available tasks time CPU finishes task starts processing task Available tasks time CPU finishes task becomes idle Constraints taskslength enqueueTimei processingTimei
