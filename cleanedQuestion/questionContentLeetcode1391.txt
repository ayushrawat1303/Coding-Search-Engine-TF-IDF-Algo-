Unique Length Palindromic Subsequences Given string return number unique palindromes length three subsequence Note even if there multiple ways obtain same subsequence it still only counted once palindrome string reads same forwards backwards subsequence string new string generated from original string with some characters can be none deleted without changing relative order remaining characters For example ace subsequence abcde Example Input aabca Output Explanation palindromic subsequences length aba subsequence aabca aaa subsequence aabca aca subsequence aabca Example Input adc Output Explanation There no palindromic subsequences length adc Example Input bbcbaba Output Explanation palindromic subsequences length bbb subsequence bbcbaba bcb subsequence bbcbaba bab subsequence bbcbaba aba subsequence bbcbaba Constraints slength consists only lowercase English letters
