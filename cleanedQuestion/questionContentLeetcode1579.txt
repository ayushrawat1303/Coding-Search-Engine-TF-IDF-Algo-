Count Artifacts Can Be Extracted There indexed grid with some artifacts buried it You given integer indexed integer array artifacts describing positions rectangular artifacts where artifacts denotes ith artifact buried subgrid where ri ci coordinate topleft cell ith artifact ri ci coordinate bottomright cell ith artifact You will excavate some cells grid remove all mud from them If cell has part artifact buried underneath it will be uncovered If all parts artifact uncovered you can extract it Given indexed integer array dig where dig indicates you will excavate cell ri ci return number artifacts you can extract test cases generated such No two artifacts overlap Each artifact only covers most cells entries dig unique Example Input artifacts dig Output Explanation different colors represent different artifacts Excavated cells labeled with grid There artifact can be extracted namely red artifact blue artifact has one part cell which remains uncovered so we cannot extract it Thus we return Example Input artifacts dig Output Explanation Both red blue artifacts have all parts uncovered labeled with can be extracted so we return Constraints artifactslength diglength minn artifactslength diglength ri ci ri ci ri ci ri ri ci ci No two artifacts will overlap number cells covered by artifact most entries dig unique
