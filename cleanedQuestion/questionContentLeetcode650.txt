Pancake Sorting Given array integers arr sort array by performing series pancake flips one pancake flip we do following steps Choose integer where arrlength Reverse subarray arr indexed For example if arr we performed pancake flip choosing we reverse subarray so arr after pancake flip Return array kvalues corresponding sequence pancake flips sort arr Any valid answer sorts array within arrlength flips will be judged as correct Example Input arr Output Explanation We perform pancake flips with values Starting state arr After st flip arr After nd flip arr After rd flip arr After th flip arr which sorted Example Input arr Output Explanation input already sorted so there no need flip anything Note other answers such as would also be accepted Constraints arrlength arr arrlength All integers arr unique ie arr permutation integers from arrlength
