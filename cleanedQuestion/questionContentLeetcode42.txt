String Integer atoi Implement myAtoistring function which converts string bit signed integer similar CCs atoi function algorithm for myAtoistring as follows Read ignore any leading whitespace Check if next character if not already end string Read this character if it either This determines if final result negative positive respectively Assume result positive if neither present Read next characters until next nondigit character end input reached rest string ignored Convert these digits into integer ie If no digits were read then integer Change sign as necessary from step If integer out bit signed integer range then clamp integer so it remains range Specifically integers less than should be clamped integers greater than should be clamped Return integer as final result Note Only space character considered whitespace character Do not ignore any characters other than leading whitespace rest string after digits Example Input Output Explanation underlined characters what read caret current reader position Step no characters read because there no leading whitespace Step no characters read because there neither nor Step read parsed integer Since range final result Example Input Output Explanation Step leading whitespace read ignored Step read so result should be negative Step read parsed integer Since range final result Example Input with words Output Explanation Step with words no characters read because there no leading whitespace Step with words no characters read because there neither nor Step with words read reading stops because next character nondigit parsed integer Since range final result Constraints slength consists English letters lowercase uppercase digits
