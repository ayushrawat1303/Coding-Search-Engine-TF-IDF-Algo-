Reverse Bits Reverse bits given bits unsigned integer Note Note some languages such as Java there no unsigned integer type this case both input output will be given as signed integer type They should not affect your implementation as integers internal binary representation same whether it signed unsigned Java compiler represents signed integers using complement notation Therefore Example above input represents signed integer output represents signed integer Example Input Output Explanation input binary string represents unsigned integer so return which its binary representation Example Input Output Explanation input binary string represents unsigned integer so return which its binary representation Constraints input must be binary string length Follow up If this function called many times how would you optimize it
