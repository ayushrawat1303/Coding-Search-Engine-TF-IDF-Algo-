Minimum Number Vertices Reach All Nodes Given directed acyclic graph with vertices numbered from array edges where edges represents directed edge from node fromi node toi Find smallest set vertices from which all nodes graph reachable Its guaranteed unique solution exists Notice you can return vertices any order Example Input edges Output Explanation Its not possible reach all nodes from single vertex From we can reach From we can reach So we output Example Input edges Output Explanation Notice vertices not reachable from any other node so we must include them Also any these vertices can reach nodes Constraints edgeslength min edgeslength fromi toi All pairs fromi toi distinct
