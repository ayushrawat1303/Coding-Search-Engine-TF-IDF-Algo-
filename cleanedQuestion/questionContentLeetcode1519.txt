Divide String Into Groups Size string can be partitioned into groups size using following procedure first group consists first characters string second group consists next characters string so on Each character can be part exactly one group For last group if string does not have characters remaining character fill used complete group Note partition done so after removing fill character from last group if it exists concatenating all groups order resultant string should be Given string size each group character fill return string array denoting composition every group has been divided into using above procedure Example Input abcdefghi fill Output Explanation first characters abc form first group next characters def form second group last characters ghi form third group Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from string we do not need use fill Thus groups formed abc def ghi Example Input abcdefghij fill Output Explanation Similar previous example we forming first three groups abc def ghi For last group we can only use character from string complete this group we add twice Thus groups formed abc def ghi jxx Constraints slength consists lowercase English letters only fill lowercase English letter
