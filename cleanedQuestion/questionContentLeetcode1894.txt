Find Array Concatenation Value You given indexed integer array nums concatenation two numbers number formed by concatenating their numerals For example concatenation concatenation value nums initially equal Perform this operation until nums becomes empty If there exists more than one number nums pick first element last element nums respectively add value their concatenation concatenation value nums then delete first last element from nums If one element exists add its value concatenation value nums then delete it Return concatenation value nums Example Input nums Output Explanation Before performing any operation nums concatenation value first operation We pick first element last element Their concatenation we add it concatenation value so it becomes equal Then we delete them from nums so nums becomes equal second operation We pick first element last element Their concatenation we add it concatenation value so it becomes equal Then we delete them from nums so nums becomes empty Since concatenation value so answer Example Input nums Output Explanation Before performing any operation nums concatenation value first operation We pick first element last element Their concatenation we add it concatenation value so it becomes equal Then we delete them from nums so nums becomes equal second operation We pick first element last element Their concatenation we add it concatenation value so it becomes equal Then we delete them from nums so nums becomes equal third operation nums has only one element so we pick add it concatenation value so it becomes equal Then we delete it from nums so nums become empty Since concatenation value so answer Constraints numslength nums
