Minimum Weighted Subgraph With Required Paths You given integer denoting number nodes weighted directed graph nodes numbered from You also given integer array edges where edges denotes there exists directed edge from fromi toi with weight weighti Lastly you given three distinct integers src src dest denoting three distinct nodes graph Return minimum weight subgraph graph such it possible reach dest from both src src via set edges this subgraph case such subgraph does not exist return subgraph graph whose vertices edges subsets original graph weight subgraph sum weights its constituent edges Example Input edges src src dest Output Explanation above figure represents input graph blue edges represent one subgraphs yield optimal answer Note subgraph also yields optimal answer It not possible get subgraph with less weight satisfying all constraints Example Input edges src src dest Output Explanation above figure represents input graph It can be seen there does not exist any path from node node hence there no subgraphs satisfying all constraints Constraints edgeslength edgeslength fromi toi src src dest fromi toi src src dest pairwise distinct weight
