Number Good Paths There tree ie connected undirected graph with no cycles consisting nodes numbered from exactly edges You given indexed integer array vals length where vals denotes value ith node You also given integer array edges where edges denotes there exists undirected edge connecting nodes ai bi good path simple path satisfies following conditions starting node ending node have same value All nodes between starting node ending node have values less than equal starting node ie starting nodes value should be maximum value along path Return number distinct good paths Note path its reverse counted as same path For example considered be same as single node also considered as valid path Example Input vals edges Output Explanation There good paths consisting single node There additional good path reverse path treated as same as Note not good path because vals vals Example Input vals edges Output Explanation There good paths consisting single node There additional good paths Example Input vals edges Output Explanation tree consists only one node so there one good path Constraints valslength vals edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi edges represents valid tree
