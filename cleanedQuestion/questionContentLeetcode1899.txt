Minimum Time Visit Cell Grid You given matrix grid consisting nonnegative integers where grid represents minimum time required be able visit cell row col which means you can visit cell row col only when time you visit it greater than equal grid You standing topleft cell matrix th second you must move any adjacent cell four directions up down left right Each move you make takes second Return minimum time required which you can visit bottomright cell matrix If you cannot visit bottomright cell then return Example Input grid Output Explanation One paths we can take following we on cell we move cell It possible because grid we move cell It possible because grid we move cell It possible because grid we move cell It possible because grid we move cell It possible because grid we move cell It possible because grid we move cell It possible because grid final time It can be shown it minimum time possible Example Input grid Output Explanation There no path from top left bottomright cell Constraints gridlength gridlength grid grid
