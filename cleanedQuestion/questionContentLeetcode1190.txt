Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality You given array network towers towers where towers denotes ith network tower with location xi yi quality factor qi All coordinates integral coordinates on XY plane distance between two coordinates Euclidean distance You also given integer radius where tower reachable if distance less than equal radius Outside distance signal becomes garbled tower not reachable signal quality ith tower coordinate calculated with formula qi where distance between tower coordinate network quality coordinate sum signal qualities from all reachable towers Return array representing integral coordinate cx cy where network quality maximum If there multiple coordinates with same network quality return lexicographically minimum nonnegative coordinate Note coordinate lexicographically smaller than if either val greatest integer less than equal val floor function Example Input towers radius Output Explanation coordinate total quality Quality from results sqrt Quality from results sqrt Quality from results sqrt No other coordinate has higher network quality Example Input towers radius Output Explanation Since there only one tower network quality highest right towers location Example Input towers radius Output Explanation Coordinate has highest network quality Constraints towerslength towerslength xi yi qi radius
