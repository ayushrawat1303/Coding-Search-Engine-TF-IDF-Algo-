Maximum Product Length Two Palindromic Subsequences Given string find two disjoint palindromic subsequences such product their lengths maximized two subsequences disjoint if they do not both pick character same index Return maximum possible product lengths two palindromic subsequences subsequence string can be derived from another string by deleting some no characters without changing order remaining characters string palindromic if it reads same forward backward Example Input leetcodecom Output Explanation optimal solution choose ete for st subsequence cdc for nd subsequence product their lengths Example Input bb Output Explanation optimal solution choose first character for st subsequence second character for nd subsequence product their lengths Example Input accbcaxxcxx Output Explanation optimal solution choose accca for st subsequence xxcxx for nd subsequence product their lengths Constraints slength consists lowercase English letters only
