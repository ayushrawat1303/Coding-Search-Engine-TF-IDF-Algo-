Count Palindromic Subsequences Given string digits return number palindromic subsequences having length Since answer may be very large return it modulo Note string palindromic if it reads same forward backward subsequence string can be derived from another string by deleting some no characters without changing order remaining characters Example Input Output Explanation There possible subsequences length Two them both equal palindromic Example Input Output Explanation All subsequences which palindromic Example Input Output Explanation only two palindromic subsequences Constraints slength consists digits
