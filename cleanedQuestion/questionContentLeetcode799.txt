Lowest Common Ancestor Deepest Leaves Given root binary tree return lowest common ancestor its deepest leaves Recall node binary tree leaf if only if it has no children depth root tree if depth node depth each its children lowest common ancestor set nodes node with largest depth such every node subtree with root Example Input root Output Explanation We return node with value colored yellow diagram nodes coloured blue deepest leafnodes tree Note nodes also leaf nodes but depth them but depth nodes Example Input root Output Explanation root deepest node tree its lca itself Example Input root Output Explanation deepest leaf node tree lca one node itself Constraints number nodes tree will be range Nodeval values nodes tree unique Note This question same as httpsleetcodecomproblemssmallestsubtreewithallthedeepestnodes
