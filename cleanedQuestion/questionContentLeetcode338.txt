Longest Uncommon Subsequence Given two strings return length longest uncommon subsequence between If longest uncommon subsequence does not exist return uncommon subsequence between two strings string subsequence one but not other subsequence string string can be obtained after deleting any number characters from For example abc subsequence aebdc because you can delete underlined characters aebdc get abc Other subsequences aebdc include aebdc aeb empty string Example Input aba cdc Output Explanation One longest uncommon subsequence aba because aba subsequence aba but not cdc Note cdc also longest uncommon subsequence Example Input aaa bbb Output Explanation longest uncommon subsequences aaa bbb Example Input aaa aaa Output Explanation Every subsequence string also subsequence string Similarly every subsequence string also subsequence string Constraints alength blength consist lowercase English letters
