Maximum Product After Increments You given array nonnegative integers nums integer one operation you may choose any element from nums increment it by Return maximum product nums after most operations Since answer may be very large return it modulo Note you should maximize product before taking modulo Example Input nums Output Explanation Increment first number times Now nums with product It can be shown maximum product possible so we return Note there may be other ways increment nums have maximum product Example Input nums Output Explanation Increment second number time increment fourth number time Now nums with product It can be shown maximum product possible so we return Note there may be other ways increment nums have maximum product Constraints numslength nums
