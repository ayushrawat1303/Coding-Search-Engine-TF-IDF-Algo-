Pacific Atlantic Water Flow There rectangular island borders both Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean touches islands left top edges Atlantic Ocean touches islands right bottom edges island partitioned into grid square cells You given integer matrix heights where heights represents height above sea level cell coordinate island receives lot rain rain water can flow neighboring cells directly north south east west if neighboring cells height less than equal current cells height Water can flow from any cell adjacent ocean into ocean Return list grid coordinates result where result denotes rain water can flow from cell ri ci both Pacific Atlantic oceans Example Input heights Output Explanation following cells can flow Pacific Atlantic oceans as shown below Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean Note there other possible paths for these cells flow Pacific Atlantic oceans Example Input heights Output Explanation water can flow from only cell Pacific Atlantic oceans Constraints heightslength heightslength heights
