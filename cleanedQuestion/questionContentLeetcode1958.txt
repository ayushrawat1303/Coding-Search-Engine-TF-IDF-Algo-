Memoize Given function fn return memoized version function memoized function function will never be called twice with same inputs Instead it will return cached value You can assume there possible input functions sum fib factorial sum accepts two integers returns fib accepts single integer returns if fibn fibn otherwise factorial accepts single integer returns if factorialn otherwise Example Input sum Output Explanation const sum const memoizedSum memoizesum memoizedSum Returns sum was called as was not seen before memoizedSum Returns However sum was not called because same inputs were seen before Total call count memoizedSum Returns sum was called as was not seen before Total call count Example Input factorial Output Explanation const factorial factorialn const memoFactorial memoizefactorial memoFactorial Returns memoFactorial Returns memoFactorial Returns However factorial was not called because was seen before Total call count memoFactorial Returns However factorial was not called because was seen before Total call count Example Input fib Output Explanation fib Total call count Constraints most function calls most attempts access callCount input function sum fib factorial
