Find String with LCP We define lcp matrix any indexed string word lowercase English letters as grid such lcp equal length longest common prefix between substrings word word Given matrix lcp return alphabetically smallest string word corresponds lcp If there no such string return empty string string lexicographically smaller than string same length if first position where differ string has letter appears earlier alphabet than corresponding letter For example aabd lexicographically smaller than aaca because first position they differ third letter comes before Example Input lcp Output abab Explanation lcp corresponds any letter string with two alternating letters lexicographically smallest them abab Example Input lcp Output aaaa Explanation lcp corresponds any letter string with single distinct letter lexicographically smallest them aaaa Example Input lcp Output Explanation lcp cannot be equal since word consists only single letter Thus no answer exists Constraints lcplength lcplength lcp
