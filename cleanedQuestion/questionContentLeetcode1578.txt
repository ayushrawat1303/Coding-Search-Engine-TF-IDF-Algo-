Count Number Rectangles Containing Each Point You given integer array rectangles where rectangles indicates ith rectangle has length li height hi You also given integer array points where points point with coordinates xj yj ith rectangle has its bottomleft corner point coordinates its topright corner point li hi Return integer array count length pointslength where count number rectangles contain jth point ith rectangle contains jth point if xj li yj hi Note points lie on edges rectangle also considered be contained by rectangle Example Input rectangles points Output Explanation first rectangle contains no points second rectangle contains only point third rectangle contains points number rectangles contain point number rectangles contain point Therefore we return Example Input rectangles points Output Explanation first rectangle contains only point second rectangle contains only point third rectangle contains points number rectangles contain point number rectangles contain point Therefore we return Constraints rectangleslength pointslength rectangleslength pointslength li xj hi yj All rectangles unique All points unique
