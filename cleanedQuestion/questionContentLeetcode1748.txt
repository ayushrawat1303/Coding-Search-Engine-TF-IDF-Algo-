Reverse Odd Levels Binary Tree Given root perfect binary tree reverse node values each odd level tree For example suppose node values level then it should become Return root reversed tree binary tree perfect if all parent nodes have two children all leaves on same level level node number edges along path between it root node Example Input root Output Explanation tree has only one odd level nodes level respectively which reversed become Example Input root Output Explanation nodes level which reversed become Example Input root Output Explanation odd levels have nonzero values nodes level were after reversal nodes level were after reversal Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval root perfect binary tree
