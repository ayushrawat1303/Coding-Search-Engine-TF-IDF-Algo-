Maximum Segment Sum After Removals You given two indexed integer arrays nums removeQueries both length For ith query element nums index removeQueries removed splitting nums into different segments segment contiguous sequence positive integers nums segment sum sum every element segment Return integer array answer length where answer maximum segment sum after applying ith removal Note same index will not be removed more than once Example Input nums removeQueries Output Explanation Using indicate removed element answer as follows Query Remove th element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove rd element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove nd element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove th element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove st element nums becomes maximum segment sum since there no segments Finally we return Example Input nums removeQueries Output Explanation Using indicate removed element answer as follows Query Remove rd element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove nd element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove st element nums becomes maximum segment sum for segment Query Remove th element nums becomes maximum segment sum since there no segments Finally we return Constraints numslength removeQuerieslength nums removeQueries All values removeQueries unique
