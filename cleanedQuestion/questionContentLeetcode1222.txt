Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities There cities numbered from You given array edges size where edges represents bidirectional edge between cities ui vi There exists unique path between each pair cities other words cities form tree subtree subset cities where every city reachable from every other city subset where path between each pair passes through only cities from subset Two subtrees different if there city one subtree not present other For each from find number subtrees which maximum distance between any two cities subtree equal Return array size where dth element indexed number subtrees which maximum distance between any two cities equal Notice distance between two cities number edges path between them Example Input edges Output Explanation subtrees with subsets have max distance subtrees with subsets have max distance No subtree has two nodes where max distance between them Example Input edges Output Example Input edges Output Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ui vi All pairs ui vi distinct
