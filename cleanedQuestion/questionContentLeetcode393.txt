Number Atoms Given string formula representing chemical formula return count each atom atomic element always starts with uppercase character then zero more lowercase letters representing name One more digits representing elements count may follow if count greater than If count no digits will follow For example HO HO possible but HO impossible Two formulas concatenated together produce another formula For example HOHeMg also formula formula placed parentheses count optionally added also formula For example HO HO formulas Return count all elements as string following form first name sorted order followed by its count if count more than followed by second name sorted order followed by its count if count more than so on test cases generated so all values output fit bit integer Example Input formula HO Output HO Explanation count elements Example Input formula MgOH Output HMgO Explanation count elements Mg Example Input formula KONSO Output KNOS Explanation count elements Constraints formulalength formula consists English letters digits formula always valid
