Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than Equal You given binary string positive integer Return length longest subsequence makes up binary number less than equal Note subsequence can contain leading zeroes empty string considered be equal subsequence string can be derived from another string by deleting some no characters without changing order remaining characters Example Input Output Explanation longest subsequence makes up binary number less than equal as this number equal decimal Note also possible which equal decimal respectively length this subsequence so returned Example Input Output Explanation longest subsequence makes up binary number less than equal as this number equal decimal length this subsequence so returned Constraints slength either
