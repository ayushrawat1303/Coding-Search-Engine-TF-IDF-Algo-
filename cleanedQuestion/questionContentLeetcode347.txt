Optimal Division You given integer array nums adjacent integers nums will perform float division For example for nums we will evaluate expression However you can add any number parenthesis any position change priority operations You want add these parentheses such value expression after evaluation maximum Return corresponding expression has maximum value string format Note your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis Example Input nums Output Explanation However bold parenthesis redundant since they do not influence operation priority So you should return Other cases Example Input nums Output Explanation It can be shown after trying all possibilities we cannot get expression with evaluation greater than Constraints numslength nums There only one optimal division for given input
