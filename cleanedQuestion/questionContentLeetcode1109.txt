Number Nodes SubTree With Same Label You given tree ie connected undirected graph has no cycles consisting nodes numbered from exactly edges root tree node each node tree has label which lowercase character given string labels ie node with number has label labels edges array given on form edges which means there edge between nodes ai bi tree Return array size where ans number nodes subtree ith node which have same label as node subtree tree tree consisting node all its descendant nodes Example Input edges labels abaedcd Output Explanation Node has label its subtree has node with label as well thus answer Notice any node part its subtree Node has label subtree node contains nodes as nodes have different labels than node answer just node itself Example Input edges labels bbbb Output Explanation subtree node contains only node so answer subtree node contains only node so answer subtree node contains nodes both have label thus answer subtree node contains nodes all with label thus answer Example Input edges labels aabab Output Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi labelslength labels consisting only lowercase English letters
