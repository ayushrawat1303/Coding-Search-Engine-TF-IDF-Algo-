Building HO There two kinds threads oxygen hydrogen Your goal group these threads form water molecules There barrier where each thread has wait until complete molecule can be formed Hydrogen oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen releaseOxygen methods respectively which will allow them pass barrier These threads should pass barrier groups three they must immediately bond with each other form water molecule You must guarantee all threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from next molecule do other words If oxygen thread arrives barrier when no hydrogen threads present it must wait for two hydrogen threads If hydrogen thread arrives barrier when no other threads present it must wait for oxygen thread another hydrogen thread We do not have worry about matching threads up explicitly threads do not necessarily know which other threads they paired up with key threads pass barriers complete sets thus if we examine sequence threads bind divide them into groups three each group should contain one oxygen two hydrogen threads Write synchronization code for oxygen hydrogen molecules enforces these constraints Example Input water HOH Output HHO Explanation HOH OHH also valid answers Example Input water OOHHHH Output HHOHHO Explanation HOHHHO OHHHHO HHOHOH HOHHOH OHHHOH HHOOHH HOHOHH OHHOHH also valid answers Constraints waterlength water either There will be exactly water There will be exactly water
