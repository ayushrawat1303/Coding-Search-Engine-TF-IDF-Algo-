Minimum Genetic Mutation gene string can be represented by character long string with choices from Suppose we need investigate mutation from gene string startGene gene string endGene where one mutation defined as one single character changed gene string For example AACCGGTT AACCGGTA one mutation There also gene bank bank records all valid gene mutations gene must be bank make it valid gene string Given two gene strings startGene endGene gene bank bank return minimum number mutations needed mutate from startGene endGene If there no such mutation return Note starting point assumed be valid so it might not be included bank Example Input startGene AACCGGTT endGene AACCGGTA bank Output Example Input startGene AACCGGTT endGene AAACGGTA bank Output Constraints banklength startGenelength endGenelength banklength startGene endGene bank consist only characters
