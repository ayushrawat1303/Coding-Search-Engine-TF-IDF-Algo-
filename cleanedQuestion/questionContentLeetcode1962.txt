Minimum Operations Make All Array Elements Equal You given array nums consisting positive integers You also given integer array queries size For ith query you want make all elements nums equal queries You can perform following operation on array any number times Increase decrease element array by Return array answer size where answer minimum number operations make all elements nums equal queries Note after each query array reset its original state Example Input nums queries Output Explanation For first query we can do following operations Decrease nums times so nums Decrease nums times so nums Decrease nums times so nums So total number operations for first query For second query we can do following operations Increase nums times so nums Increase nums times so nums Decrease nums time so nums Decrease nums times so nums So total number operations for second query Example Input nums queries Output Explanation We can increase each value array total number operations will be Constraints numslength querieslength nums queries
