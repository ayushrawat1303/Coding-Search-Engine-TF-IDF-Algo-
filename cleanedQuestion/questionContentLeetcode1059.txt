Max Value Equation You given array points containing coordinates points on plane sorted by xvalues where points such xi xj for all pointslength You also given integer Return maximum value equation yi yj xi xj where xi xj pointslength It guaranteed there exists least one pair points satisfy constraint xi xj Example Input points Output Explanation first two points satisfy condition xi xj if we calculate equation we get Third fourth points also satisfy condition give value No other pairs satisfy condition so we return max Example Input points Output Explanation Only first two points have absolute difference less xvalues give value Constraints pointslength pointslength xi yi xi xj for all pointslength xi form strictly increasing sequence
