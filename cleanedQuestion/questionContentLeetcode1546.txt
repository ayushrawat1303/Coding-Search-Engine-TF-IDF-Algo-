Destroying Asteroids You given integer mass which represents original mass planet You further given integer array asteroids where asteroids mass ith asteroid You can arrange for planet collide with asteroids any arbitrary order If mass planet greater than equal mass asteroid asteroid destroyed planet gains mass asteroid Otherwise planet destroyed Return true if all asteroids can be destroyed Otherwise return false Example Input mass asteroids Output true Explanation One way order asteroids planet collides with asteroid with mass New planet mass planet collides with asteroid with mass New planet mass planet collides with asteroid with mass New planet mass planet collides with asteroid with mass New planet mass planet collides with asteroid with mass New planet mass All asteroids destroyed Example Input mass asteroids Output false Explanation planet cannot ever gain enough mass destroy asteroid with mass After planet destroys other asteroids it will have mass This less than so collision would not destroy last asteroid Constraints mass asteroidslength asteroids
