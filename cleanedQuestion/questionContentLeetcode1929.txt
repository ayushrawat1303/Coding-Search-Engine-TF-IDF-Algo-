Put Marbles Bags You have bags You given indexed integer array weights where weights weight ith marble You also given integer Divide marbles into bags according following rules No bag empty If ith marble jth marble bag then all marbles with index between ith jth indices should also be same bag If bag consists all marbles with index from inclusively then cost bag weights weights score after distributing marbles sum costs all bags Return difference between maximum minimum scores among marble distributions Example Input weights Output Explanation distribution results minimal score distribution results maximal score Thus we return their difference Example Input weights Output Explanation only distribution possible Since both maximal minimal score same we return Constraints weightslength weights
