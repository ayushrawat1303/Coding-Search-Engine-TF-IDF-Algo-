Basic Calculator IV Given expression such as expression evaluation map such as given terms evalvars evalints return list tokens representing simplified expression such as expression alternates chunks symbols with space separating each chunk symbol chunk either expression parentheses variable nonnegative integer variable string lowercase letters not including digits Note variables can be multiple letters note variables never have leading coefficient unary operator like Expressions evaluated usual order brackets first then multiplication then addition subtraction For example expression has answer format output as follows For each term free variables with nonzero coefficient we write free variables within term sorted order lexicographically For example we would never write term like bac only abc Terms have degrees equal number free variables being multiplied counting multiplicity We write largest degree terms our answer first breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring leading coefficient term For example aabc has degree leading coefficient term placed directly left with asterisk separating it from variables if they exist leading coefficient still printed example wellformatted answer Terms including constant terms with coefficient not included For example expression has output Note You may assume given expression always valid All intermediate results will be range Example Input expression evalvars evalints Output Example Input expression temperature pressure evalvars evalints Output Example Input expression evalvars evalints Output Constraints expressionlength expression consists lowercase English letters digits expression does not contain any leading trailing spaces All tokens expression separated by single space evalvarslength evalvarslength evalvars consists lowercase English letters evalintslength evalvarslength evalints
