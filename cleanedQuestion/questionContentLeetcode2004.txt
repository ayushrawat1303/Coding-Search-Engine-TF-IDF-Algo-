Make Costs Paths Equal Binary Tree You given integer representing number nodes perfect binary tree consisting nodes numbered from root tree node each node tree has two children where left child node right child Each node tree also has cost represented by given indexed integer array cost size where cost cost node You allowed increment cost any node by any number times Return minimum number increments you need make cost paths from root each leaf node equal Note perfect binary tree tree where each node except leaf nodes has exactly children cost path sum costs nodes path Example Input cost Output Explanation We can do following increments Increase cost node one time Increase cost node three times Increase cost node two times Each path from root leaf will have total cost total increments we did It can be shown this minimum answer we can achieve Example Input cost Output Explanation two paths already have equal total costs so no increments needed Constraints power costlength cost
