Minimum Reverse Operations You given integer integer range Representing indexed array arr length where all positions set except position which set You also given integer array banned containing some positions from array For ith position banned arr banned You can perform multiple operations on arr operation you can choose subarray with size reverse subarray However arr should never go any positions banned other words after each operation arr remains Return array ans where for each from ans minimum number reverse operations needed bring position arr if it impossible subarray contiguous nonempty sequence elements within array values ans independent for all reverse array array containing values reverse order Example Input banned Output Explanation this case so there only one possible reverse operation we can perform which reversing whole array Initially placed position so amount operations we need for position We can never place on banned positions so answer for positions Finally with one reverse operation we can bring index so answer for position Example Input banned Output Explanation this case initially position so answer for position We can perform reverse operations size currently located position so we need reverse subarray for it leave position but reversing subarray makes position have which shouldnt happen So we cant move from position making result for all other positions Example Input banned Output Explanation this case we can only perform reverse operations size So never changes its position Constraints bannedlength banned banned all values banned unique
