Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum alternating sum indexed array defined as sum elements even indices minus sum elements odd indices For example alternating sum Given array nums return maximum alternating sum any subsequence nums after reindexing elements subsequence subsequence array new array generated from original array by deleting some elements possibly none without changing remaining elements relative order For example subsequence underlined elements while not Example Input nums Output Explanation It optimal choose subsequence with alternating sum Example Input nums Output Explanation It optimal choose subsequence with alternating sum Example Input nums Output Explanation It optimal choose subsequence with alternating sum Constraints numslength nums
