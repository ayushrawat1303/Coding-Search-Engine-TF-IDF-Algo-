Intervals Between Identical Elements You given indexed array integers arr interval between two elements arr defined as absolute difference between their indices More formally interval between arr arr Return array intervals length where intervals sum intervals between arr each element arr with same value as arr Note absolute value Example Input arr Output Explanation Index Another found index Index Another found index Index Two more found indices Index Another found index Index Another found index Index Two more found indices Index Two more found indices Example Input arr Output Explanation Index Two more found indices Index There only one array so its sum intervals identical elements Index Two more found indices Index Two more found indices Constraints arrlength arr
