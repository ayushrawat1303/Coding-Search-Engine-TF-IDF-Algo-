Logical Two Binary Grids Represented as QuadTrees Binary Matrix matrix which all elements either Given quadTree quadTree quadTree represents binary matrix quadTree represents another binary matrix Return QuadTree representing binary matrix which result logical bitwise two binary matrixes represented by quadTree quadTree Notice you can assign value node True False when isLeaf False both accepted answer QuadTree tree data structure which each internal node has exactly four children Besides each node has two attributes val True if node represents grid False if node represents grid isLeaf True if node leaf node on tree False if node has four children class Node public boolean val public boolean isLeaf public Node topLeft public Node topRight public Node bottomLeft public Node bottomRight We can construct QuadTree from twodimensional area using following steps If current grid has same value ie all all set isLeaf True set val value grid set four children Null stop If current grid has different values set isLeaf False set val any value divide current grid into four subgrids as shown photo Recurse for each children with proper subgrid If you want know more about QuadTree you can refer wiki QuadTree format inputoutput represents serialized format QuadTree using level order traversal where null signifies path terminator where no node exists below It very similar serialization binary tree only difference node represented as list If value isLeaf val True we represent it as list if value isLeaf val False we represent it as Example Input quadTree quadTree nullnullnullnull Output Explanation quadTree quadTree shown above You can see binary matrix which represented by each QuadTree If we apply logical bitwise on two binary matrices we get binary matrix below which represented by result QuadTree Notice binary matrices shown only for illustration you dont have construct binary matrix get result tree Example Input quadTree quadTree Output Explanation Each tree represents binary matrix size Each matrix contains only zero resulting matrix size with also zero Constraints quadTree quadTree both valid QuadTrees each representing grid where
