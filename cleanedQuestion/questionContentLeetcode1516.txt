Abbreviating Product Range You given two positive integers left right with left right Calculate product all integers inclusive range Since product may be very large you will abbreviate it following these steps Count all trailing zeros product remove them Let us denote this count as For example there trailing zeros there trailing zeros Denote remaining number digits product as If then express product as presuf where pre denotes first digits product suf denotes last digits product after removing all trailing zeros If we keep it unchanged For example we express as but represented as Finally represent product as string presufeC For example will be represented as Return string denoting abbreviated product all integers inclusive range Example Input left right Output Explanation product There no trailing zeros so remains same abbreviation will end with Since number digits which less than we do not have abbreviate it further Thus final representation Example Input left right Output Explanation product There trailing zeros which we remove get abbreviation will end with number digits after removing trailing zeros so we do not abbreviate it further Hence abbreviated product Example Input left right Output Explanation product Constraints left right
