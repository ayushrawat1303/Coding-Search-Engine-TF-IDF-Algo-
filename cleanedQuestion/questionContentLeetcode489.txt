Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence You given string digits num such as We can split it into Fibonaccilike sequence Formally Fibonaccilike sequence list nonnegative integers such each integer fits bit signed integer type flength for all flength Note when splitting string into pieces each piece must not have extra leading zeroes except if piece number itself Return any Fibonaccilike sequence split from num return if it cannot be done Example Input num Output Explanation output would also be accepted Example Input num Output Explanation task impossible Example Input num Output Explanation Leading zeroes not allowed so not valid Constraints numlength num contains only digits
