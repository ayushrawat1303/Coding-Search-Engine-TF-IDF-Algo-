Check if Point Reachable There exists infinitely large grid You currently point you need reach point targetX targetY using finite number steps one step you can move from point any one following points Given two integers targetX targetY representing Xcoordinate Ycoordinate your final position return true if you can reach point from using some number steps false otherwise Example Input targetX targetY Output false Explanation It impossible reach from using any sequence moves so false returned Example Input targetX targetY Output true Explanation You can follow path Constraints targetX targetY
