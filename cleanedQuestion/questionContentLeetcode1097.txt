Path with Maximum Probability You given undirected weighted graph nodes indexed represented by edge list where edges undirected edge connecting nodes with probability success traversing edge succProb Given two nodes start end find path with maximum probability success go from start end return its success probability If there no path from start end return Your answer will be accepted if it differs from correct answer by most Example Input edges succProb start end Output Explanation There two paths from start end one having probability success other has Example Input edges succProb start end Output Example Input edges succProb start end Output Explanation There no path between Constraints start end start end succProblength edgeslength succProb There most one edge between every two nodes
