Lowest Common Ancestor Binary Search Tree Given binary search tree BST find lowest common ancestor LCA node two given nodes BST According definition LCA on Wikipedia lowest common ancestor defined between two nodes as lowest node has both as descendants where we allow node be descendant itself Example Input root Output Explanation LCA nodes Example Input root Output Explanation LCA nodes since node can be descendant itself according LCA definition Example Input root Output Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval All Nodeval unique will exist BST
