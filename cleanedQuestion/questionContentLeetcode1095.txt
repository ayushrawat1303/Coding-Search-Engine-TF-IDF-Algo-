String Compression II Runlength encoding string compression method works by replacing consecutive identical characters repeated more times with concatenation character number marking count characters length run For example compress string aabccc we replace aa by replace ccc by Thus compressed string becomes abc Notice this problem we not adding after single characters Given string integer You need delete most characters from such runlength encoded version has minimum length Find minimum length runlength encoded version after deleting most characters Example Input aaabcccd Output Explanation Compressing without deleting anything will give us abcd length Deleting any characters would most decrease length compressed string for instance delete then we will have abcccd which compressed abcd Therefore optimal way delete then compressed version will be ac length Example Input aabbaa Output Explanation If we delete both characters resulting compressed string would be length Example Input aaaaaaaaaaa Output Explanation Since zero we cannot delete anything compressed string length Constraints slength slength contains only lowercase English letters
