Print Order Suppose we have class public class Foo public void first printfirst public void second printsecond public void third printthird same instance Foo will be passed three different threads Thread will call first thread will call second thread will call third Design mechanism modify program ensure second executed after first third executed after second Note We do not know how threads will be scheduled operating system even though numbers input seem imply ordering input format you see mainly ensure our tests comprehensiveness Example Input nums Output firstsecondthird Explanation There three threads being fired asynchronously input means thread calls first thread calls second thread calls third firstsecondthird correct output Example Input nums Output firstsecondthird Explanation input means thread calls first thread calls third thread calls second firstsecondthird correct output Constraints nums permutation
