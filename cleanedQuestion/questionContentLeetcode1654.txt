Minimum Score After Removals on Tree There undirected connected tree with nodes labeled from edges You given indexed integer array nums length where nums represents value ith node You also given integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree Remove two distinct edges tree form three connected components For pair removed edges following steps defined Get XOR all values nodes for each three components respectively difference between largest XOR value smallest XOR value score pair For example say three components have node values three XOR values largest XOR value smallest XOR value score then Return minimum score any possible pair edge removals on given tree Example Input nums edges Output Explanation diagram above shows way make pair removals st component has nodes with values Its XOR value nd component has node with value Its XOR value rd component has node with value Its XOR value score difference between largest smallest XOR value which It can be shown no other pair removals will obtain smaller score than Example Input nums edges Output Explanation diagram above shows way make pair removals st component has nodes with values Its XOR value nd component has nodes with values Its XOR value rd component has nodes with values Its XOR value score difference between largest smallest XOR value which We cannot obtain smaller score than Constraints numslength nums edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi edges represents valid tree
