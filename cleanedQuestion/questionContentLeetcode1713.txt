Maximum Number Robots Within Budget You have robots You given two indexed integer arrays chargeTimes runningCosts both length ith robot costs chargeTimes units charge costs runningCosts units run You also given integer budget total cost running chosen robots equal maxchargeTimes sumrunningCosts where maxchargeTimes largest charge cost among robots sumrunningCosts sum running costs among robots Return maximum number consecutive robots you can run such total cost does not exceed budget Example Input chargeTimes runningCosts budget Output Explanation It possible run all individual consecutive pairs robots within budget obtain answer consider first robots total cost will be max sum which less than It can be shown it not possible run more than consecutive robots within budget so we return Example Input chargeTimes runningCosts budget Output Explanation No robot can be run does not exceed budget so we return Constraints chargeTimeslength runningCostslength chargeTimes runningCosts budget
