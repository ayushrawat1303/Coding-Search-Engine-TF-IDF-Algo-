Image Overlap You given two images img img represented as binary square matrices size binary matrix has only as values We translate one image however we choose by sliding all bits left right up andor down any number units We then place it on top other image We can then calculate overlap by counting number positions have both images Note also translation does not include any kind rotation Any bits translated outside matrix borders erased Return largest possible overlap Example Input img img Output Explanation We translate img right by unit down by unit number positions have both images shown red Example Input img img Output Example Input img img Output Constraints imglength imglength imglength imglength img either img either
