Minimum Cost Path With Special Roads You given array start where start represents your initial position startX startY space You also given array target where target represents your target position targetX targetY cost going from position any other position space There also some special roads You given array specialRoads where specialRoads indicates ith special road can take you from xi yi xi yi with cost equal costi You can use each special road any number times Return minimum cost required go from startX startY targetX targetY Example Input start target specialRoads Output Explanation optimal path from following This move has cost This move uses first special edge cost This move has cost This move uses second special edge cost So total cost It can be shown we cannot achieve smaller total cost than Example Input start target specialRoads Output Explanation It optimal not use any special edges go directly from starting ending position with cost Constraints startlength targetlength startX targetX startY targetY specialRoadslength specialRoadslength startX xi xi targetX startY yi yi targetY costi
