Reachable Nodes With Restrictions There undirected tree with nodes labeled from edges You given integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree You also given integer array restricted which represents restricted nodes Return maximum number nodes you can reach from node without visiting restricted node Note node will not be restricted node Example Input edges restricted Output Explanation diagram above shows tree We have only nodes can be reached from node without visiting restricted node Example Input edges restricted Output Explanation diagram above shows tree We have only nodes can be reached from node without visiting restricted node Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi edges represents valid tree restrictedlength restricted All values restricted unique
