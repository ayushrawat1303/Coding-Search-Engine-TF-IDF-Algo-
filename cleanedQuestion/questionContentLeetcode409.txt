Network Delay Time You given network nodes labeled from You also given times list travel times as directed edges times ui vi wi where ui source node vi target node wi time it takes for signal travel from source target We will send signal from given node Return minimum time it takes for all nodes receive signal If it impossible for all nodes receive signal return Example Input times Output Example Input times Output Example Input times Output Constraints timeslength timeslength ui vi ui vi wi All pairs ui vi unique ie no multiple edges
