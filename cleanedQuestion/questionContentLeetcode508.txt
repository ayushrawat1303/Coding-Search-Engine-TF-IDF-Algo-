Bricks Falling When Hit You given binary grid where each represents brick represents empty space brick stable if It directly connected top grid least one other brick its four adjacent cells stable You also given array hits which sequence erasures we want apply Each time we want erase brick location hits rowi coli brick on location if it exists will disappear Some other bricks may no longer be stable because erasure will fall Once brick falls it immediately erased from grid ie it does not land on other stable bricks Return array result where each result number bricks will fall after ith erasure applied Note erasure may refer location with no brick if it does no bricks drop Example Input grid hits Output Explanation Starting with grid We erase underlined brick resulting grid two underlined bricks no longer stable as they no longer connected top nor adjacent another stable brick so they will fall resulting grid Hence result Example Input grid hits Output Explanation Starting with grid We erase underlined brick resulting grid All remaining bricks still stable so no bricks fall grid remains same Next we erase underlined brick resulting grid Once again all remaining bricks still stable so no bricks fall Hence result Constraints gridlength gridlength grid hitslength hitslength xi yi All xi yi unique
