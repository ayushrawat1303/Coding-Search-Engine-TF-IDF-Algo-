bit bit Characters We have two special characters first character can be represented by one bit second character can be represented by two bits Given binary array bits ends with return true if last character must be onebit character Example Input bits Output true Explanation only way decode it twobit character onebit character So last character onebit character Example Input bits Output false Explanation only way decode it twobit character twobit character So last character not onebit character Constraints bitslength bits either
