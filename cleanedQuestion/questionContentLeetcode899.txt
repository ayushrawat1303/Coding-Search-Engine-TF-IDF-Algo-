Dice Roll Simulation die simulator generates random number from for each roll You introduced constraint generator such it cannot roll number more than rollMax indexed consecutive times Given array integers rollMax integer return number distinct sequences can be obtained with exact rolls Since answer may be too large return it modulo Two sequences considered different if least one element differs from each other Example Input rollMax Output Explanation There will be rolls die if there no constraints on die there possible combinations this case looking rollMax array numbers appear most once consecutively therefore sequences cannot occur so final answer Example Input rollMax Output Example Input rollMax Output Constraints rollMaxlength rollMax
