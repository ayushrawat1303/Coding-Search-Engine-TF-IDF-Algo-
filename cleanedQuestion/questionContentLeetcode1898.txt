Find Score Array After Marking All Elements You given array nums consisting positive integers Starting with score apply following algorithm Choose smallest integer array not marked If there tie choose one with smallest index Add value chosen integer score Mark chosen element its two adjacent elements if they exist Repeat until all array elements marked Return score you get after applying above algorithm Example Input nums Output Explanation We mark elements as follows smallest unmarked element so we mark it its two adjacent elements smallest unmarked element so we mark it its left adjacent element only remaining unmarked element so we mark it Our score Example Input nums Output Explanation We mark elements as follows smallest unmarked element so we mark it its two adjacent elements smallest unmarked element since there two them we choose leftmost one so we mark one index its right adjacent element only remaining unmarked element so we mark it Our score Constraints numslength nums
