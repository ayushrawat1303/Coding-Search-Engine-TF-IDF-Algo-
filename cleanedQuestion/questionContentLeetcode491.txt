Ambiguous Coordinates We had some dimensional coordinates like Then we removed all commas decimal points spaces ended up with string For example becomes becomes Return list strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes so we never started with numbers like any other number can be represented with fewer digits Also decimal point within number never occurs without least one digit occurring before it so we never started with numbers like final answer list can be returned any order All coordinates final answer have exactly one space between them occurring after comma Example Input Output Example Input Output Explanation not allowed Example Input Output Constraints slength rest digits
