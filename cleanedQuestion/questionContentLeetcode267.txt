Can Win game two players take turns adding running total any integer from player who first causes running total reach exceed wins What if we change game so players cannot reuse integers For example two players might take turns drawing from common pool numbers from without replacement until they reach total Given two integers maxChoosableInteger desiredTotal return true if first player move can force win otherwise return false Assume both players play optimally Example Input maxChoosableInteger desiredTotal Output false Explanation No matter which integer first player choose first player will lose first player can choose integer from up If first player choose second player can only choose integers from up second player will win by choosing get total which desiredTotal Same with other integers chosen by first player second player will always win Example Input maxChoosableInteger desiredTotal Output true Example Input maxChoosableInteger desiredTotal Output true Constraints maxChoosableInteger desiredTotal
