Collect Coins Tree There exists undirected unrooted tree with nodes indexed from You given integer integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree You also given array coins size where coins can be either where indicates presence coin vertex Initially you choose start any vertex tree Then you can perform following operations any number times Collect all coins distance most from current vertex Move any adjacent vertex tree Find minimum number edges you need go through collect all coins go back initial vertex Note if you pass edge several times you need count it into answer several times Example Input coins edges Output Explanation Start vertex collect coin vertex move vertex collect coin vertex then move back vertex Example Input coins edges Output Explanation Start vertex collect coins vertices move vertex collect coin vertex then move back vertex Constraints coinslength coins edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi edges represents valid tree
