Random Flip Matrix There binary grid matrix with all values set initially Design algorithm randomly pick index where matrix flips it All indices where matrix should be equally likely be returned Optimize your algorithm minimize number calls made builtin random function your language optimize time space complexity Implement Solution class Solutionint int Initializes object with size binary matrix int flip Returns random index matrix where matrix flips it void reset Resets all values matrix be Example Input Output null Explanation Solution solution new Solution solutionflip return should be equally likely be returned solutionflip return Since was returned solutionflip return Based on previously returned indices only can be returned solutionreset All values reset can be returned solutionflip return should be equally likely be returned Constraints There will be least one free cell for each call flip most calls will be made flip reset
