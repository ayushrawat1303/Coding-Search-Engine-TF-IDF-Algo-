Disconnect Path Binary Matrix by Most One Flip You given indexed binary matrix grid You can move from cell row col any cells row col row col has value matrix disconnected if there no path from You can flip value most one possibly none cell You cannot flip cells Return true if it possible make matrix disconnect false otherwise Note flipping cell changes its value from from Example Input grid Output true Explanation We can change cell shown diagram above There no path from resulting grid Example Input grid Output false Explanation It not possible change most one cell such there not path from Constraints gridlength gridlength grid either grid grid
