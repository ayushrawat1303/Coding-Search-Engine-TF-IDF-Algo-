Count Ways Build Good Strings Given integers zero one low high we can construct string by starting with empty string then each step perform either following Append character zero times Append character one times This can be performed any number times good string string constructed by above process having length between low high inclusive Return number different good strings can be constructed satisfying these properties Since answer can be large return it modulo Example Input low high zero one Output Explanation One possible valid good string It can be constructed as follows All binary strings from good strings this example Example Input low high zero one Output Explanation good strings Constraints low high zero one low
