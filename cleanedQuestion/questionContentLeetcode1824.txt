Maximum Star Sum Graph There undirected graph consisting nodes numbered from You given indexed integer array vals length where vals denotes value ith node You also given integer array edges where edges denotes there exists undirected edge connecting nodes ai bi star graph subgraph given graph having center node containing more neighbors other words it subset edges given graph such there exists common node for all edges image below shows star graphs with neighbors respectively centered blue node star sum sum values all nodes present star graph Given integer return maximum star sum star graph containing most edges Example Input vals edges Output Explanation above diagram represents input graph star graph with maximum star sum denoted by blue It centered includes its neighbors It can be shown it not possible get star graph with sum greater than Example Input vals edges Output Explanation There only one possible star graph which node itself Hence we return Constraints valslength vals edgeslength minn edgeslength ai bi ai bi
