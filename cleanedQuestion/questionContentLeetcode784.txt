Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String You given two strings same length string baseStr We say equivalent characters For example if abc cde then we have Equivalent characters follow usual rules any equivalence relation Reflexivity Symmetry implies Transitivity implies For example given equivalency information from abc cde acd aab equivalent strings baseStr eed aab lexicographically smallest equivalent string baseStr Return lexicographically smallest equivalent string baseStr by using equivalency information from Example Input parker morris baseStr parser Output makkek Explanation Based on equivalency information we can group their characters as characters each group equivalent sorted lexicographical order So answer makkek Example Input hello world baseStr hold Output hdld Explanation Based on equivalency information we can group their characters as So only second letter baseStr changed answer hdld Example Input leetcode programs baseStr sourcecode Output aauaaaaada Explanation We group equivalent characters as thus all letters baseStr except transformed answer aauaaaaada Constraints slength slength baseStr slength slength baseStr consist lowercase English letters
