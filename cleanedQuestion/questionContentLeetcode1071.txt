Find Two Nonoverlapping Subarrays Each With Target Sum You given array integers arr integer target You have find two nonoverlapping subarrays arr each with sum equal target There can be multiple answers so you have find answer where sum lengths two subarrays minimum Return minimum sum lengths two required subarrays return if you cannot find such two subarrays Example Input arr target Output Explanation Only two subarrays have sum sum their lengths Example Input arr target Output Explanation Although we have three nonoverlapping subarrays sum but we will choose first third subarrays as sum their lengths Example Input arr target Output Explanation We have only one subarray sum Constraints arrlength arr target
