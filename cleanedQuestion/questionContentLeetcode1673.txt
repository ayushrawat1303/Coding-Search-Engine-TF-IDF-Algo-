Minimum Path Cost Grid You given indexed integer matrix grid consisting distinct integers from You can move this matrix from cell any other cell next row if you cell such you can move any cells Note it not possible move from cells last row Each possible move has cost given by indexed array moveCost size where moveCost cost moving from cell with value cell column next row cost moving from cells last row grid can be ignored cost path grid sum all values cells visited plus sum costs all moves made Return minimum cost path starts from any cell first row ends any cell last row Example Input grid moveCost Output Explanation path with minimum possible cost path sum values cells visited cost moving from cost moving from So total cost path Example Input grid moveCost Output Explanation path with minimum possible cost path sum values cells visited cost moving from So total cost this path Constraints gridlength gridlength grid consists distinct integers from moveCostlength moveCostlength moveCost
