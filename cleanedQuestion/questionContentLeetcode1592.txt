Count Collisions on Road There cars on infinitely long road cars numbered from from left right each car present unique point You given indexed string directions length directions can be either denoting whether ith car moving towards left towards right staying its current point respectively Each moving car has same speed number collisions can be calculated as follows When two cars moving opposite directions collide with each other number collisions increases by When moving car collides with stationary car number collisions increases by After collision cars involved can no longer move will stay point where they collided Other than cars cannot change their state direction motion Return total number collisions will happen on road Example Input directions RLRSLL Output Explanation collisions will happen on road Cars will collide with each other Since they moving opposite directions number collisions becomes Cars will collide with each other Since car stationary number collisions becomes Cars will collide with each other Since car stationary number collisions becomes Cars will collide with each other After car collides with car it will stay point collision get hit by car number collisions becomes Thus total number collisions will happen on road Example Input directions LLRR Output Explanation No cars will collide with each other Thus total number collisions will happen on road Constraints directionslength directions either
