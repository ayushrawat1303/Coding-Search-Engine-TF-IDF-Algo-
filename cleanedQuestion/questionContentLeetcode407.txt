Asteroid Collision We given array asteroids integers representing asteroids row For each asteroid absolute value represents its size sign represents its direction positive meaning right negative meaning left Each asteroid moves same speed Find out state asteroids after all collisions If two asteroids meet smaller one will explode If both same size both will explode Two asteroids moving same direction will never meet Example Input asteroids Output Explanation collide resulting never collide Example Input asteroids Output Explanation collide exploding each other Example Input asteroids Output Explanation collide resulting collide resulting Constraints asteroidslength asteroids asteroids
