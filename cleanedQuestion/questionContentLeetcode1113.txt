Maximum Number NonOverlapping Substrings Given string lowercase letters you need find maximum number nonempty substrings meet following conditions substrings do not overlap for any two substrings either true substring contains certain character must also contain all occurrences Find maximum number substrings meet above conditions If there multiple solutions with same number substrings return one with minimum total length It can be shown there exists unique solution minimum total length Notice you can return substrings any order Example Input adefaddaccc Output Explanation following all possible substrings meet conditions adefaddaccc adefadda ef ccc If we choose first string we cannot choose anything else wed get only If we choose adefadda we left with ccc which only one doesnt overlap thus obtaining substrings Notice also its not optimal choose ef since it can be split into two Therefore optimal way choose which gives us substrings No other solution same number substrings exist Example Input abbaccd Output Explanation Notice while set substrings also has length its considered incorrect since it has larger total length Constraints slength contains only lowercase English letters
