Number Sets NonOverlapping Line Segments Given points on plane where ith point from find number ways we can draw exactly nonoverlapping line segments such each segment covers two more points endpoints each segment must have integral coordinates line segments do not have cover all points they allowed share endpoints Return number ways we can draw nonoverlapping line segments Since this number can be huge return it modulo Example Input Output Explanation two line segments shown red blue image above shows different ways Example Input Output Explanation ways Example Input Output Explanation total number possible ways draw line segments Taking this number modulo gives us Constraints
