Divide Nodes Into Maximum Number Groups You given positive integer representing number nodes undirected graph nodes labeled from You also given integer array edges where edges indicates there bidirectional edge between nodes ai bi Notice given graph may be disconnected Divide nodes graph into groups indexed such Each node graph belongs exactly one group For every pair nodes graph connected by edge if ai belongs group with index bi belongs group with index then Return maximum number groups ie maximum into which you can divide nodes Return if it impossible group nodes with given conditions Example Input edges Output Explanation As shown image we Add node first group Add node second group Add nodes third group Add nodes fourth group We can see every edge satisfied It can be shown if we create fifth group move any node from third fourth group it least on edges will not be satisfied Example Input edges Output Explanation If we add node first group node second group node third group satisfy first two edges we can see third edge will not be satisfied It can be shown no grouping possible Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi There most one edge between any pair vertices
