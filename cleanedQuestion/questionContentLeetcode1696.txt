Node With Highest Edge Score You given directed graph with nodes labeled from where each node has exactly one outgoing edge graph represented by given indexed integer array edges length where edges indicates there directed edge from node node edges edge score node defined as sum labels all nodes have edge pointing Return node with highest edge score If multiple nodes have same edge score return node with smallest index Example Input edges Output Explanation nodes have edge pointing node edge score node node has edge pointing node edge score node node has edge pointing node edge score node nodes have edge pointing node edge score node Node has highest edge score so return Example Input edges Output Explanation nodes have edge pointing node edge score node nodes have edge pointing node edge score node Nodes both have edge score Since node has smaller index we return Constraints edgeslength edges edges
