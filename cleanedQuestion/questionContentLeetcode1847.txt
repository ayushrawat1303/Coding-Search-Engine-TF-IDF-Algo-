Cycle Length Queries Tree You given integer There complete binary tree with nodes root tree node with value every node with value val range has two children where left node has value val right node has value val You also given integer array queries length where queries For each query solve following problem Add edge between nodes with values ai bi Find length cycle graph Remove added edge between nodes with values ai bi Note cycle path starts ends same node each edge path visited only once length cycle number edges visited cycle There could be multiple edges between two nodes tree after adding edge query Return array answer length where answer answer ith query Example Input queries Output Explanation diagrams above show tree nodes Nodes colored red describe nodes cycle after adding edge After adding edge between nodes graph contains cycle nodes Thus answer first query We delete added edge process next query After adding edge between nodes graph contains cycle nodes Thus answer second query We delete added edge process next query After adding edge between nodes graph contains cycle nodes Thus answer third query We delete added edge Example Input queries Output Explanation diagram above shows tree nodes Nodes colored red describe nodes cycle after adding edge After adding edge between nodes graph contains cycle nodes Thus answer for first query We delete added edge Constraints querieslength querieslength ai bi ai bi
