Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations You given string even length consisting digits from two integers You can apply either following two operations any number times any order on Add all odd indices indexed Digits post cycled back For example if becomes Rotate right by positions For example if becomes Return lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying above operations any number times on string lexicographically smaller than string same length if first position where differ string has letter appears earlier alphabet than corresponding letter For example lexicographically smaller than because first position they differ third letter comes before Example Input Output Explanation We can apply following operations Start Rotate Add Add Rotate Add Add Rotate Add There no way obtain string lexicographically smaller then Example Input Output Explanation We can apply following operations Start Rotate Add Rotate There no way obtain string lexicographically smaller then Example Input Output Explanation There no sequence operations will give us lexicographically smaller string than Constraints slength slength even consists digits from only slength
