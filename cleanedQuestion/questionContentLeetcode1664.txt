Shortest Impossible Sequence Rolls You given integer array rolls length integer You roll sided dice numbered from times where result ith roll rolls Return length shortest sequence rolls cannot be taken from rolls sequence rolls length len result rolling sided dice len times Note sequence taken does not have be consecutive as long as it order Example Input rolls Output Explanation Every sequence rolls length can be taken from rolls Every sequence rolls length can be taken from rolls sequence cannot be taken from rolls so we return Note there other sequences cannot be taken from rolls Example Input rolls Output Explanation Every sequence rolls length can be taken from rolls sequence cannot be taken from rolls so we return Note there other sequences cannot be taken from rolls but shortest Example Input rolls Output Explanation sequence cannot be taken from rolls so we return Note there other sequences cannot be taken from rolls but shortest Constraints rollslength rolls
