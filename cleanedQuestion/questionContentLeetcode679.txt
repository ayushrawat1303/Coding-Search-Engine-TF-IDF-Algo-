Odd Even Jump You given integer array arr From some starting index you can make series jumps st rd th jumps series called oddnumbered jumps nd th th jumps series called evennumbered jumps Note jumps numbered not indices You may jump forward from index index with following way During oddnumbered jumps ie jumps you jump index such arr arr arr smallest possible value If there multiple such indices you can only jump smallest such index During evennumbered jumps ie jumps you jump index such arr arr arr largest possible value If there multiple such indices you can only jump smallest such index It may be case for some index there no legal jumps starting index good if starting from index you can reach end array index arrlength by jumping some number times possibly more than once Return number good starting indices Example Input arr Output Explanation From starting index we can make our st jump since arr smallest among arr arr arr arr greater equal arr then we cannot jump any more From starting index we can make our st jump then we cannot jump any more From starting index we can make our st jump so we have reached end From starting index we have reached end already total there different starting indices where we can reach end with some number jumps Example Input arr Output Explanation From starting index we make jumps During our st jump oddnumbered we first jump because arr smallest value arr arr arr greater than equal arr During our nd jump evennumbered we jump from because arr largest value arr arr less than equal arr arr also largest value but smaller index so we can only jump not During our rd jump oddnumbered we jump from because arr smallest value arr greater than equal arr We cant jump from so starting index not good similar manner we can deduce From starting index we jump so we reach end From starting index we jump then we cant jump anymore From starting index we jump so we reach end From starting index we already end total there different starting indices where we can reach end with some number jumps Example Input arr Output Explanation We can reach end from starting indices Constraints arrlength arr
