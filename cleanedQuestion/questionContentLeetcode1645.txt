Divisible Elements Subarrays Given integer array nums two integers return number distinct subarrays which have most elements divisible by Two arrays nums nums said be distinct if They different lengths There exists least one index where nums nums subarray defined as nonempty contiguous sequence elements array Example Input nums Output Explanation elements indices divisible by distinct subarrays which have most elements divisible by Note subarrays occur more than once nums but they should each be counted only once subarray should not be counted because it has elements divisible by Example Input nums Output Explanation All element nums divisible by Also every subarray nums will have most elements divisible by Since all subarrays distinct total number subarrays satisfying all constraints Constraints numslength nums numslength Follow up Can you solve this problem On time complexity
