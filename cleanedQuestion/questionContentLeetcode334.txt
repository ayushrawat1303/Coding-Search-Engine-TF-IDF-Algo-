Find Mode Binary Search Tree Given root binary search tree BST with duplicates return all modes ie most frequently occurred element it If tree has more than one mode return them any order Assume BST defined as follows left subtree node contains only nodes with keys less than equal nodes key right subtree node contains only nodes with keys greater than equal nodes key Both left right subtrees must also be binary search trees Example Input root Output Example Input root Output Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval Follow up Could you do without using any extra space Assume implicit stack space incurred due recursion does not count
