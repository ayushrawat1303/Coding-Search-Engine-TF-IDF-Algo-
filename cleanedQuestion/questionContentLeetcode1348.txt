Minimum Number Operations Make String Sorted You given string indexed You asked perform following operation on until you get sorted string Find largest index such slength Find largest index such slength for all possible values range inclusive Swap two characters indices Reverse suffix starting index Return number operations needed make string sorted Since answer can be too large return it modulo Example Input cba Output Explanation simulation goes as follows Operation Swap get scab then reverse suffix starting Now scab Operation Swap get sbac then reverse suffix starting Now sbca Operation Swap get sbac then reverse suffix starting Now sbac Operation Swap get sabc then reverse suffix starting Now sacb Operation Swap get sabc then reverse suffix starting Now sabc Example Input aabaa Output Explanation simulation goes as follows Operation Swap get saaaab then reverse substring starting Now saaaba Operation Swap get saaaab then reverse substring starting Now saaaab Constraints slength consists only lowercase English letters
