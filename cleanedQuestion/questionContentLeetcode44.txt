Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array Given integer array nums sorted nondecreasing order remove duplicates inplace such each unique element appears only once relative order elements should be kept same Then return number unique elements nums Consider number unique elements nums be get accepted you need do following things Change array nums such first elements nums contain unique elements order they were present nums initially remaining elements nums not important as well as size nums Return Custom Judge judge will test your solution with following code int nums Input array int expectedNums expected answer with correct length int removeDuplicatesnums Calls your implementation assert expectedNumslength for int assert nums expectedNums If all assertions pass then your solution will be accepted Example Input nums Output nums Explanation Your function should return with first two elements nums being respectively It does not matter what you leave beyond returned hence they underscores Example Input nums Output nums Explanation Your function should return with first five elements nums being respectively It does not matter what you leave beyond returned hence they underscores Constraints numslength nums nums sorted nondecreasing order
