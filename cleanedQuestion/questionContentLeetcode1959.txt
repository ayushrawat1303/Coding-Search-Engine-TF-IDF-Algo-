Prime Subtraction Operation You given indexed integer array nums length You can perform following operation as many times as you want Pick index you havent picked before pick prime strictly less than nums then subtract from nums Return true if you can make nums strictly increasing array using above operation false otherwise strictly increasing array array whose each element strictly greater than its preceding element Example Input nums Output true Explanation first operation Pick then subtract from nums so nums becomes second operation subtract from nums so nums becomes equal After second operation nums sorted strictly increasing order so answer true Example Input nums Output true Explanation Initially nums sorted strictly increasing order so we dont need make any operations Example Input nums Output false Explanation It can be proven there no way perform operations make nums sorted strictly increasing order so answer false Constraints numslength nums numslength
