Minimum Time Collect All Apples Tree Given undirected tree consisting vertices numbered from which has some apples their vertices You spend second walk over one edge tree Return minimum time seconds you have spend collect all apples tree starting vertex coming back this vertex edges undirected tree given array edges where edges means exists edge connecting vertices ai bi Additionally there boolean array hasApple where hasApple true means vertex has apple otherwise it does not have any apple Example Input edges hasApple Output Explanation figure above represents given tree where red vertices have apple One optimal path collect all apples shown by green arrows Example Input edges hasApple Output Explanation figure above represents given tree where red vertices have apple One optimal path collect all apples shown by green arrows Example Input edges hasApple Output Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi hasApplelength
