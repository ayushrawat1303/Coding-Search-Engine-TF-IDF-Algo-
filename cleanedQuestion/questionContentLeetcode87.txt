Intersection Two Linked Lists Given heads two singly linkedlists headA headB return node which two lists intersect If two linked lists have no intersection all return null For example following two linked lists begin intersect node test cases generated such there no cycles anywhere entire linked structure Note linked lists must retain their original structure after function returns Custom Judge inputs judge given as follows your program not given these inputs intersectVal value node where intersection occurs This if there no intersected node listA first linked list listB second linked list skipA number nodes skip ahead listA starting from head get intersected node skipB number nodes skip ahead listB starting from head get intersected node judge will then create linked structure based on these inputs pass two heads headA headB your program If you correctly return intersected node then your solution will be accepted Example Input intersectVal listA listB skipA skipB Output Intersected Explanation intersected nodes value note this must not be if two lists intersect From head it reads as From head it reads as There nodes before intersected node There nodes before intersected node Note intersected nodes value not because nodes with value nd node rd node different node references other words they point two different locations memory while nodes with value rd node th node point same location memory Example Input intersectVal listA listB skipA skipB Output Intersected Explanation intersected nodes value note this must not be if two lists intersect From head it reads as From head it reads as There nodes before intersected node There node before intersected node Example Input intersectVal listA listB skipA skipB Output No intersection Explanation From head it reads as From head it reads as Since two lists do not intersect intersectVal must be while skipA skipB can be arbitrary values Explanation two lists do not intersect so return null Constraints number nodes listA number nodes listB Nodeval skipA skipB intersectVal if listA listB do not intersect intersectVal listA listB if listA listB intersect Follow up Could you write solution runs Om time use only memory
