Apply Bitwise Operations Make Strings Equal You given two indexed binary strings target same length You can do following operation on any number times Choose two different indices where Simultaneously replace with with XOR For example if you can choose then simultaneously replace with with XOR XOR so we will have Return true if you can make string equal target false otherwise Example Input target Output true Explanation We can do following operations Choose We have now Choose We have now Since we can make equal target we return true Example Input target Output false Explanation It not possible make equal target with any number operations Constraints slength targetlength target consist only digits
