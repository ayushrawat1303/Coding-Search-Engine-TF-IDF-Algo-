Random Pick with Weight You given indexed array positive integers where describes weight ith index You need implement function pickIndex which randomly picks index range inclusive returns it probability picking index sumw For example if probability picking index ie probability picking index ie Example Input Output Explanation Solution solution new Solution solutionpickIndex return only option return since there only one element Example Input Output Explanation Solution solution new Solution solutionpickIndex return It returning second element index has probability solutionpickIndex return solutionpickIndex return solutionpickIndex return solutionpickIndex return It returning first element index has probability Since this randomization problem multiple answers allowed All following outputs can be considered correct so on Constraints wlength pickIndex will be called most times
