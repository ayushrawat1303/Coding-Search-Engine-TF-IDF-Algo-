Build Matrix With Conditions You given positive integer You also given integer array rowConditions size where rowConditions integer array colConditions size where colConditions two arrays contain integers from You have build matrix contains each numbers from exactly once remaining cells should have value matrix should also satisfy following conditions number abovei should appear row strictly above row which number belowi appears for all from number lefti should appear column strictly left column which number righti appears for all from Return any matrix satisfies conditions If no answer exists return empty matrix Example Input rowConditions colConditions Output Explanation diagram above shows valid example matrix satisfies all conditions row conditions following Number row number row so above matrix Number row number row so above matrix column conditions following Number column number column so left matrix Number column number column so left matrix Note there may be multiple correct answers Example Input rowConditions colConditions Output Explanation From first two conditions has be below but third conditions needs be above be satisfied No matrix can satisfy all conditions so we return empty matrix Constraints rowConditionslength colConditionslength rowConditionslength colConditionslength abovei belowi lefti righti abovei belowi lefti righti
