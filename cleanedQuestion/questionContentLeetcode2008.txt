Find Distinct Difference Array You given indexed array nums length distinct difference array nums array diff length such diff equal number distinct elements suffix nums subtracted from number distinct elements prefix nums Return distinct difference array nums Note nums denotes subarray nums starting index ending index inclusive Particularly if then nums denotes empty subarray Example Input nums Output Explanation For index there element prefix distinct elements suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix distinct elements suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix distinct elements suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix distinct element suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix no elements suffix Thus diff Example Input nums Output Explanation For index there element prefix distinct elements suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix distinct elements suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix distinct elements suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix distinct element suffix Thus diff For index there distinct elements prefix no elements suffix Thus diff Constraints numslength nums
