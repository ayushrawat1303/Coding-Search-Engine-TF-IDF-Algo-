Number Ways Reconstruct Tree You given array pairs where pairs There no duplicates xi yi Let ways be number rooted trees satisfy following conditions tree consists nodes whose values appeared pairs pair exists pairs if only if xi ancestor yi yi ancestor xi Note tree does not have be binary tree Two ways considered be different if there least one node has different parents both ways Return if ways if ways if ways rooted tree tree has single root node all edges oriented be outgoing from root ancestor node any node on path from root node excluding node itself root has no ancestors Example Input pairs Output Explanation There exactly one valid rooted tree which shown above figure Example Input pairs Output Explanation There multiple valid rooted trees Three them shown above figures Example Input pairs Output Explanation There no valid rooted trees Constraints pairslength xi yi elements pairs unique
