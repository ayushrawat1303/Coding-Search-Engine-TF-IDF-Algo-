Merge BSTs Create Single BST You given BST binary search tree root nodes for separate BSTs stored array trees indexed Each BST trees has most nodes no two roots have same value one operation you can Select two distinct indices such value stored one leaves trees equal root value trees Replace leaf node trees with trees Remove trees from trees Return root resulting BST if it possible form valid BST after performing operations null if it impossible create valid BST BST binary search tree binary tree where each node satisfies following property Every node nodes left subtree has value strictly less than nodes value Every node nodes right subtree has value strictly greater than nodes value leaf node has no children Example Input trees Output Explanation first operation pick merge trees into trees Delete trees so trees second operation pick merge trees into trees Delete trees so trees resulting tree shown above valid BST so return its root Example Input trees Output Explanation Pick merge trees into trees Delete trees so trees resulting tree shown above This only valid operation can be performed but resulting tree not valid BST so return null Example Input trees Output Explanation It impossible perform any operations Constraints treeslength number nodes each tree range Each node input may have children but no grandchildren No two roots trees have same value All trees input valid BSTs TreeNodeval
