Maximum Genetic Difference Query There rooted tree consisting nodes numbered Each nodes number denotes its unique genetic value ie genetic value node genetic difference between two genetic values defined as bitwiseXOR their values You given integer array parents where parents parent for node If node root tree then parents You also given array queries where queries For each query find maximum genetic difference between vali pi where pi genetic value any node on path between nodei root including nodei root More formally you want maximize vali XOR pi Return array ans where ans answer ith query Example Input parents queries Output Explanation queries processed as follows node with maximum genetic difference with difference XOR node with maximum genetic difference with difference XOR node with maximum genetic difference with difference XOR Example Input parents queries Output Explanation queries processed as follows node with maximum genetic difference with difference XOR node with maximum genetic difference with difference XOR node with maximum genetic difference with difference XOR Constraints parentslength parents parentslength for every node not root parents querieslength nodei parentslength vali
