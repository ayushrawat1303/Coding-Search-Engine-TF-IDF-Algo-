Arithmetic Slices II Subsequence Given integer array nums return number all arithmetic subsequences nums sequence numbers called arithmetic if it consists least three elements if difference between any two consecutive elements same For example arithmetic sequences For example not arithmetic sequence subsequence array sequence can be formed by removing some elements possibly none array For example subsequence test cases generated so answer fits bit integer Example Input nums Output Explanation All arithmetic subsequence slices Example Input nums Output Explanation Any subsequence this array arithmetic Constraints numslength nums
