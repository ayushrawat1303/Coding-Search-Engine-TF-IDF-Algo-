Statistics from Large Sample You given large sample integers range Since sample so large it represented by array count where count number times appears sample Calculate following statistics minimum minimum element sample maximum maximum element sample mean average sample calculated as total sum all elements divided by total number elements median If sample has odd number elements then median middle element once sample sorted If sample has even number elements then median average two middle elements once sample sorted mode number appears most sample It guaranteed be unique Return statistics sample as array floatingpoint numbers Answers within actual answer will be accepted Example Input count Output Explanation sample represented by count minimum maximum respectively mean Since size sample even median average two middle elements which mode as it appears most sample Example Input count Output Explanation sample represented by count minimum maximum respectively mean for display purposes output shows rounded number Since size sample odd median middle element mode as it appears most sample Constraints countlength count sumcount mode sample count represents unique
