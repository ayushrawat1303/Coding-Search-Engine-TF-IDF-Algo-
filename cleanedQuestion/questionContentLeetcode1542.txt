Count Hidden Sequences You given indexed array integers differences which describes differences between each pair consecutive integers hidden sequence length More formally call hidden sequence hidden then we have differences hidden hidden You further given two integers lower upper describe inclusive range values hidden sequence can contain For example given differences lower upper hidden sequence sequence length whose elements between inclusive possible hidden sequences not possible since it contains element greater than not possible since differences not correct Return number possible hidden sequences there If there no possible sequences return Example Input differences lower upper Output Explanation possible hidden sequences Thus we return Example Input differences lower upper Output Explanation possible hidden sequences Thus we return Example Input differences lower upper Output Explanation There no possible hidden sequences Thus we return Constraints differenceslength differences lower upper
