Move Pieces Obtain String You given two strings start target both length Each string consists only characters where characters represent pieces where piece can move left only if there blank space directly its left piece can move right only if there blank space directly its right character represents blank space can be occupied by any pieces Return true if it possible obtain string target by moving pieces string start any number times Otherwise return false Example Input start _L__R__R_ target L______RR Output true Explanation We can obtain string target from start by doing following moves Move first piece one step left start becomes equal L___R__R_ Move last piece one step right start becomes equal L___R___R Move second piece three steps right start becomes equal L______RR Since it possible get string target from start we return true Example Input start R_L_ target __LR Output false Explanation piece string start can move one step right obtain _RL_ After no pieces can move anymore so it impossible obtain string target from start Example Input start _R target R_ Output false Explanation piece string start can move only right so it impossible obtain string target from start Constraints startlength targetlength start target consist characters
