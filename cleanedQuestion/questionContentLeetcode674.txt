Equal Rational Numbers Given two strings each which represents nonnegative rational number return true if only if they represent same number strings may use parentheses denote repeating part rational number rational number can be represented using up three parts IntegerPart NonRepeatingPart RepeatingPart number will be represented one following three ways IntegerPart For example IntegerPartNonRepeatingPart For example IntegerPartNonRepeatingPartRepeatingPart For example repeating portion decimal expansion conventionally denoted within pair round brackets For example Example Input Output true Explanation Because represents represents strings represent same number Example Input Output true Example Input Output true Explanation represents repeated forever which equals represents number which formed correctly IntegerPart NonRepeatingPart Constraints Each part consists only digits IntegerPart does not have leading zeros except for zero itself IntegerPartlength NonRepeatingPartlength RepeatingPartlength
