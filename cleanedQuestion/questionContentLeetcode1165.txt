Minimum Cost Connect Two Groups Points You given two groups points where first group has size points second group has size points size size cost connection between any two points given size size matrix where cost cost connecting point first group point second group groups connected if each point both groups connected one more points opposite group other words each point first group must be connected least one point second group each point second group must be connected least one point first group Return minimum cost it takes connect two groups Example Input cost Output Explanation optimal way connecting groups This results total cost Example Input cost Output Explanation optimal way connecting groups This results total cost Note there multiple points connected point first group point second group This does not matter as there no limit number points can be connected We only care about minimum total cost Example Input cost Output Constraints size costlength size costlength size size size size cost
