Minimum Number Operations Make Array Continuous You given integer array nums one operation you can replace any element nums with any integer nums considered continuous if both following conditions fulfilled All elements nums unique difference between maximum element minimum element nums equals numslength For example nums continuous but nums not continuous Return minimum number operations make nums continuous Example Input nums Output Explanation nums already continuous Example Input nums Output Explanation One possible solution change last element resulting array which continuous Example Input nums Output Explanation One possible solution Change second element Change third element Change fourth element resulting array which continuous Constraints numslength nums
