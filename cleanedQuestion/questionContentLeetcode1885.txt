Count Number Possible Root Nodes Alice has undirected tree with nodes labeled from tree represented as integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree Alice wants Bob find root tree She allows Bob make several guesses about her tree one guess he does following Chooses two distinct integers such there exists edge tree He tells Alice parent tree Bobs guesses represented by integer array guesses where guesses indicates Bob guessed uj be parent vj Alice being lazy does not reply each Bobs guesses but just says least his guesses true Given integer arrays edges guesses integer return number possible nodes can be root Alices tree If there no such tree return Example Input edges guesses Output Explanation Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Considering as root node leads correct guesses Example Input edges guesses Output Explanation Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Root correct guesses Considering any node as root will give least correct guess Constraints edgeslength guesseslength ai bi uj vj ai bi uj vj edges represents valid tree guesses edge tree guesses unique guesseslength
