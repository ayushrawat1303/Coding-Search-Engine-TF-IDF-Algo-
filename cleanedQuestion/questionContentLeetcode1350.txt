Minimum Number Operations Reinitialize Permutation You given even integer You initially have permutation perm size where perm indexed one operation you will create new array arr for each If then arr perm If then arr perm You will then assign arr perm Return minimum nonzero number operations you need perform on perm return permutation its initial value Example Input Output Explanation perm initially After st operation perm So it takes only operation Example Input Output Explanation perm initially After st operation perm After nd operation perm So it takes only operations Example Input Output Constraints even
