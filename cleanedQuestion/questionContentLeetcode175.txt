Game Life According Wikipedias article Game Life also known simply as Life cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway board made up grid cells where each cell has initial state live represented by dead represented by Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors horizontal vertical diagonal using following four rules taken from above Wikipedia article Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by underpopulation Any live cell with two three live neighbors lives on next generation Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies as if by overpopulation Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes live cell as if by reproduction next state created by applying above rules simultaneously every cell current state where births deaths occur simultaneously Given current state grid board return next state Example Input board Output Example Input board Output Constraints boardlength boardlength board Follow up Could you solve it inplace Remember board needs be updated simultaneously You cannot update some cells first then use their updated values update other cells this question we represent board using array principle board infinite which would cause problems when active area encroaches upon border array ie live cells reach border How would you address these problems
