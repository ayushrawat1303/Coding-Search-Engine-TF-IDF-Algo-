Chalkboard XOR Game You given array integers nums represents numbers written on chalkboard Alice Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from chalkboard with Alice starting first If erasing number causes bitwise XOR all elements chalkboard become then player loses bitwise XOR one element element itself bitwise XOR no elements Also if any player starts their turn with bitwise XOR all elements chalkboard equal then player wins Return true if only if Alice wins game assuming both players play optimally Example Input nums Output false Explanation Alice has two choices erase erase If she erases nums array becomes bitwise XOR all elements chalkboard XOR Now Bob can remove any element he wants because Alice will be one erase last element she will lose If Alice erases first now nums become bitwise XOR all elements chalkboard XOR Alice will lose Example Input nums Output true Example Input nums Output true Constraints numslength nums
