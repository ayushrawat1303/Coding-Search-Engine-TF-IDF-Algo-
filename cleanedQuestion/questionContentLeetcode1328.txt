Finding Users Active Minutes You given logs for users actions on LeetCode integer logs represented by integer array logs where each logs indicates user with IDi performed action minute timei Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously single user can perform multiple actions same minute user active minutes UAM for given user defined as number unique minutes which user performed action on LeetCode minute can only be counted once even if multiple actions occur during it You calculate indexed array answer size such for each answer number users whose UAM equals Return array answer as described above Example Input logs Output Explanation user with ID performed actions minutes again Hence they have UAM minute only counted once user with ID performed actions minutes Hence they have UAM Since both users have UAM answer remaining answer values Example Input logs Output Explanation user with ID performed single action minute Hence they have UAM user with ID performed actions minutes Hence they have UAM There one user with UAM one with UAM Hence answer answer remaining values Constraints logslength IDi timei range
