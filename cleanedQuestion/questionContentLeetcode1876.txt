Difference Between Maximum Minimum Price Sum There exists undirected initially unrooted tree with nodes indexed from You given integer integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree Each node has associated price You given integer array price where price price ith node price sum given path sum prices all nodes lying on path tree can be rooted any node root your choice incurred cost after choosing root difference between maximum minimum price sum amongst all paths starting root Return maximum possible cost amongst all possible root choices Example Input edges price Output Explanation diagram above denotes tree after rooting it node first part colored red shows path with maximum price sum second part colored blue shows path with minimum price sum first path contains nodes prices sum prices second path contains node with price difference between maximum minimum price sum It can be proved maximum cost Example Input edges price Output Explanation diagram above denotes tree after rooting it node first part colored red shows path with maximum price sum second part colored blue shows path with minimum price sum first path contains nodes prices sum prices second path contains node with price difference between maximum minimum price sum It can be proved maximum cost Constraints edgeslength ai bi edges represents valid tree pricelength price
