Number Distinct Averages You given indexed integer array nums even length As long as nums not empty you must repetitively Find minimum number nums remove it Find maximum number nums remove it Calculate average two removed numbers average two numbers For example average Return number distinct averages calculated using above process Note when there tie for minimum maximum number any can be removed Example Input nums Output Explanation Remove average Now nums Remove average nums Remove average Since there distinct numbers among we return Example Input nums Output Explanation There only one average be calculated after removing so we return Constraints numslength numslength even nums
