Destroy Sequential Targets You given indexed array nums consisting positive integers representing targets on number line You also given integer space You have machine which can destroy targets Seeding machine with some nums allows it destroy all targets with values can be represented as nums space where any nonnegative integer You want destroy maximum number targets nums Return minimum value nums you can seed machine with destroy maximum number targets Example Input nums space Output Explanation If we seed machine with nums then we destroy all targets equal this case we would destroy total targets all except for nums It impossible destroy more than targets so we return nums Example Input nums space Output Explanation Seeding machine with nums nums destroys targets It not possible destroy more than targets Since nums minimal integer can destroy targets we return Example Input nums space Output Explanation Whatever initial seed we select we can only destroy target minimal seed nums Constraints numslength nums space
