Calculate Digit Sum String You given string consisting digits integer round can be completed if length greater than one round do following Divide into consecutive groups size such first characters first group next characters second group so on Note size last group can be smaller than Replace each group with string representing sum all its digits For example replaced with because Merge consecutive groups together form new string If length string greater than repeat from step Return after all rounds have been completed Example Input Output Explanation For first round we divide into groups size Then we calculate digit sum each group So becomes after first round For second round we divide into Then we calculate digit sum each group So becomes after second round Now slength so we return as answer Example Input Output Explanation We divide into Then we calculate digit sum each group becomes whose length equal so we return Constraints slength consists digits only
