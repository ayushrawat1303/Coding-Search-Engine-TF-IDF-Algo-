Minimum Sideway Jumps There lane road length consists points labeled from frog starts point second lane wants jump point However there could be obstacles along way You given array obstacles length where each obstacles ranging from describes obstacle on lane obstacles point If obstacles there no obstacles point There will be most one obstacle lanes each point For example if obstacles then there obstacle on lane point frog can only travel from point point on same lane if there not obstacle on lane point avoid obstacles frog can also perform side jump jump another lane even if they not adjacent same point if there no obstacle on new lane For example frog can jump from lane point lane point Return minimum number side jumps frog needs reach any lane point starting from lane point Note There will be no obstacles on points Example Input obstacles Output Explanation optimal solution shown by arrows above There side jumps red arrows Note frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps as shown point Example Input obstacles Output Explanation There no obstacles on lane No side jumps required Example Input obstacles Output Explanation optimal solution shown by arrows above There side jumps Constraints obstacleslength obstacles obstacles obstacles
