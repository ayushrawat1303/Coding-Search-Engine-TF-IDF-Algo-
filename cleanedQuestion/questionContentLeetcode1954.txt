Cousins Binary Tree II Given root binary tree replace value each node tree with sum all its cousins values Two nodes binary tree cousins if they have same depth with different parents Return root modified tree Note depth node number edges path from root node it Example Input root Output Explanation diagram above shows initial binary tree binary tree after changing value each node Node with value does not have any cousins so its sum Node with value does not have any cousins so its sum Node with value does not have any cousins so its sum Node with value has cousin with value so its sum Node with value has cousin with value so its sum Node with value has cousins with values so its sum Example Input root Output Explanation diagram above shows initial binary tree binary tree after changing value each node Node with value does not have any cousins so its sum Node with value does not have any cousins so its sum Node with value does not have any cousins so its sum Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval
