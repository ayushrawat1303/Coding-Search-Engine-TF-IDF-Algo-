Number Good Leaf Nodes Pairs You given root binary tree integer distance pair two different leaf nodes binary tree said be good if length shortest path between them less than equal distance Return number good leaf node pairs tree Example Input root distance Output Explanation leaf nodes tree length shortest path between them This only good pair Example Input root distance Output Explanation good pairs with shortest path pair not good because length ther shortest path between them Example Input root distance Output Explanation only good pair Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval distance
