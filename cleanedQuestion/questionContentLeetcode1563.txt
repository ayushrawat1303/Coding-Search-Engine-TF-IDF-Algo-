Maximum Score Node Sequence There undirected graph with nodes numbered from You given indexed integer array scores length where scores denotes score node You also given integer array edges where edges denotes there exists undirected edge connecting nodes ai bi node sequence valid if it meets following conditions There edge connecting every pair adjacent nodes sequence No node appears more than once sequence score node sequence defined as sum scores nodes sequence Return maximum score valid node sequence with length If no such sequence exists return Example Input scores edges Output Explanation figure above shows graph chosen node sequence score node sequence It can be shown no other node sequence has score more than Note sequences also valid have score sequence not valid since no edge connects nodes Example Input scores edges Output Explanation figure above shows graph There no valid node sequences length so we return Constraints scoreslength scores edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi There no duplicate edges
