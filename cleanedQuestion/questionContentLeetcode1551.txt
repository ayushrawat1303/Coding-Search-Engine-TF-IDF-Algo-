Recover Original Array Alice had indexed array arr consisting positive integers She chose arbitrary positive integer created two new indexed integer arrays lower higher following manner lower arr for every index where higher arr for every index where Unfortunately Alice lost all three arrays However she remembers integers were present arrays lower higher but not array each integer belonged Help Alice recover original array Given array nums consisting integers where exactly integers were present lower remaining higher return original array arr case answer not unique return any valid array Note test cases generated such there exists least one valid array arr Example Input nums Output Explanation If arr we get lower higher Combining lower higher gives us which permutation nums Another valid possibility arr case lower higher Example Input nums Output Explanation If arr we get lower higher Combining lower higher gives us which equal nums Note arr cannot be because case only possible way obtain with This invalid since must be positive Example Input nums Output Explanation only possible combination arr Using them we get lower higher Constraints numslength nums test cases generated such there exists least one valid array arr
