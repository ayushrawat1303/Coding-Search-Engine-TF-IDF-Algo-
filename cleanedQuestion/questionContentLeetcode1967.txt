Snail Traversal Write code enhances all arrays such you can call snailrowsCount colsCount method transforms array into array organised pattern known as snail traversal order Invalid input values should output empty array If rowsCount colsCount numslength input considered invalid Snail traversal order starts top left cell with first value current array It then moves through entire first column from top bottom followed by moving next column on right traversing it from bottom top This pattern continues alternating direction traversal with each column until entire current array covered For example when given input array with rowsCount colsCount desired output matrix shown below Note iterating matrix following arrows corresponds order numbers original array Example Input nums rowsCount colsCount Output Example Input nums rowsCount colsCount Output Example Input nums rowsCount colsCount Output Explanation multiplied by original array has length therefore input invalid Constraints numslength nums rowsCount colsCount
