Cyclically Rotating Grid You given integer matrix grid where both even integers integer matrix composed several layers which shown below image where each color its own layer cyclic rotation matrix done by cyclically rotating each layer matrix cyclically rotate layer once each element layer will take place adjacent element counterclockwise direction example rotation shown below Return matrix after applying cyclic rotations it Example Input grid Output Explanation figures above represent grid every state Example Input grid Output Explanation figures above represent grid every state Constraints gridlength gridlength Both even integers grid
