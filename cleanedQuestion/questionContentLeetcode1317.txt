Minimum Operations Make Subsequence You given array target consists distinct integers another integer array arr can have duplicates one operation you can insert any integer any position arr For example if arr you can add middle make it Note you can insert integer very beginning end array Return minimum number operations needed make target subsequence arr subsequence array new array generated from original array by deleting some elements possibly none without changing remaining elements relative order For example subsequence underlined elements while not Example Input target arr Output Explanation You can add such way makes arr then target will be subsequence arr Example Input target arr Output Constraints targetlength arrlength target arr target contains no duplicates
