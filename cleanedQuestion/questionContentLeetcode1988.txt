Modify Graph Edge Weights You given undirected weighted connected graph containing nodes labeled from integer array edges where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi with weight wi Some edges have weight wi while others have positive weight wi Your task modify all edges with weight by assigning them positive integer values range so shortest distance between nodes source destination becomes equal integer target If there multiple modifications make shortest distance between source destination equal target any them will be considered correct Return array containing all edges even unmodified ones any order if it possible make shortest distance from source destination equal target empty array if its impossible Note You not allowed modify weights edges with initial positive weights Example Input edges source destination target Output Explanation graph above shows possible modification edges making distance from equal Example Input edges source destination target Output Explanation graph above contains initial edges It not possible make distance from equal by modifying edge with weight So empty array returned Example Input edges source destination target Output Explanation graph above shows modified graph having shortest distance from as Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi wi wi ai bi source destination source destination target graph connected there no selfloops repeated edges
