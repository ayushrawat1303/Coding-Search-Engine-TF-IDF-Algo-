Rearrange Array Elements by Sign You given indexed integer array nums even length consisting equal number positive negative integers You should rearrange elements nums such modified array follows given conditions Every consecutive pair integers have opposite signs For all integers with same sign order which they were present nums preserved rearranged array begins with positive integer Return modified array after rearranging elements satisfy aforementioned conditions Example Input nums Output Explanation positive integers nums negative integers only possible way rearrange them such they satisfy all conditions Other ways such as incorrect because they do not satisfy one more conditions Example Input nums Output Explanation only positive integer only negative integer nums So nums rearranged Constraints numslength numslength even nums nums consists equal number positive negative integers
