Neighboring Bitwise XOR indexed array derived with length derived by computing bitwise XOR adjacent values binary array original length Specifically for each index range If then derived original original Otherwise derived original original Given array derived your task determine whether there exists valid binary array original could have formed derived Return true if such array exists false otherwise binary array array containing only Example Input derived Output true Explanation valid original array gives derived derived original original derived original original derived original original Example Input derived Output true Explanation valid original array gives derived derived original original derived original original Example Input derived Output false Explanation There no valid original array gives derived Constraints derivedlength values derived either
