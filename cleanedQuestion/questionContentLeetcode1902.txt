Maximize Win From Two Segments There some prizes on Xaxis You given integer array prizePositions sorted nondecreasing order where prizePositions position ith prize There could be different prizes same position on line You also given integer You allowed select two segments with integer endpoints length each segment must be You will collect all prizes whose position falls within least one two selected segments including endpoints segments two selected segments may intersect For example if you can choose segments you will win any prize satisfies prizePositions prizePositions Return maximum number prizes you can win if you choose two segments optimally Example Input prizePositions Output Explanation this example you can win all prizes by selecting two segments Example Input prizePositions Output Explanation For this example one choice for segments you will be able get prizes Constraints prizePositionslength prizePositions prizePositions sorted nondecreasing order
