Minimum Number Operations Sort Binary Tree by Level You given root binary tree with unique values one operation you can choose any two nodes same level swap their values Return minimum number operations needed make values each level sorted strictly increasing order level node number edges along path between it root node Example Input root Output Explanation Swap nd level becomes Swap rd level becomes Swap rd level becomes We used operations so return It can be proven minimum number operations needed Example Input root Output Explanation Swap nd level becomes Swap rd level becomes Swap rd level becomes We used operations so return It can be proven minimum number operations needed Example Input root Output Explanation Each level already sorted increasing order so return Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval All values tree unique
