Skyline Problem citys skyline outer contour silhouette formed by all buildings city when viewed from distance Given locations heights all buildings return skyline formed by these buildings collectively geometric information each building given array buildings where buildings lefti coordinate left edge ith building righti coordinate right edge ith building heighti height ith building You may assume all buildings perfect rectangles grounded on absolutely flat surface height skyline should be represented as list key points sorted by their xcoordinate form Each key point left endpoint some horizontal segment skyline except last point list which always has ycoordinate used mark skylines termination where rightmost building ends Any ground between leftmost rightmost buildings should be part skylines contour Note There must be no consecutive horizontal lines equal height output skyline For instance not acceptable three lines height should be merged into one final output as such Example Input buildings Output Explanation Figure shows buildings input Figure shows skyline formed by those buildings red points figure represent key points output list Example Input buildings Output Constraints buildingslength lefti righti heighti buildings sorted by lefti nondecreasing order
