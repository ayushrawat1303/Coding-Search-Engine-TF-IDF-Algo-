Uncrossed Lines You given two integer arrays nums nums We write integers nums nums order they given on two separate horizontal lines We may draw connecting lines straight line connecting two numbers nums nums such nums nums line we draw does not intersect any other connecting nonhorizontal line Note connecting line cannot intersect even endpoints ie each number can only belong one connecting line Return maximum number connecting lines we can draw this way Example Input nums nums Output Explanation We can draw uncrossed lines as diagram We cannot draw uncrossed lines because line from nums nums will intersect line from nums nums Example Input nums nums Output Example Input nums nums Output Constraints numslength numslength nums nums
