Substring with Concatenation All Words You given string array strings words All strings words same length concatenated substring substring contains all strings any permutation words concatenated For example if words then abcdef abefcd cdabef cdefab efabcd efcdab all concatenated strings acdbef not concatenated substring because it not concatenation any permutation words Return starting indices all concatenated substrings You can return answer any order Example Input barfoothefoobarman words Output Explanation Since wordslength wordslength concatenated substring has be length substring starting barfoo It concatenation which permutation words substring starting foobar It concatenation which permutation words output order does not matter Returning fine too Example Input wordgoodgoodgoodbestword words Output Explanation Since wordslength wordslength concatenated substring has be length There no substring length equal concatenation any permutation words We return empty array Example Input barfoofoobarthefoobarman words Output Explanation Since wordslength wordslength concatenated substring has be length substring starting foobarthe It concatenation which permutation words substring starting barthefoo It concatenation which permutation words substring starting thefoobar It concatenation which permutation words Constraints slength wordslength wordslength words consist lowercase English letters
