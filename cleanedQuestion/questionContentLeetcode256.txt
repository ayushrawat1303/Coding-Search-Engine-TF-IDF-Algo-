Circular Array Loop You playing game involving circular array nonzero integers nums Each nums denotes number indices forwardbackward you must move if you located index If nums positive move nums steps forward If nums negative move nums steps backward Since array circular you may assume moving forward from last element puts you on first element moving backwards from first element puts you on last element cycle array consists sequence indices seq length where Following movement rules above results repeating index sequence seq seq seq seq Every nums either all positive all negative Return true if there cycle nums false otherwise Example Input nums Output true Explanation graph shows how indices connected White nodes jumping forward while red jumping backward We can see cycle all its nodes white jumping same direction Example Input nums Output false Explanation graph shows how indices connected White nodes jumping forward while red jumping backward only cycle size so we return false Example Input nums Output true Explanation graph shows how indices connected White nodes jumping forward while red jumping backward We can see cycle while it size it has node jumping forward node jumping backward so it not cycle We can see cycle all its nodes white jumping same direction Constraints numslength nums nums Follow up Could you solve it On time complexity extra space complexity
