Minimum NonZero Product Array Elements You given positive integer Consider array nums indexed consists integers inclusive range their binary representations You allowed do following operation any number times Choose two elements from nums Choose bit swap it with its corresponding bit Corresponding bit refers bit same position other integer For example if after swapping nd bit from right we have Find minimum nonzero product nums after performing above operation any number times Return this product modulo Note answer should be minimum product before modulo operation done Example Input Output Explanation nums There only one element so product equals element Example Input Output Explanation nums Any swap would either make product stay same Thus array product already minimized Example Input Output Explanation nums first operation we can swap leftmost bit second fifth elements resulting array second operation we can swap middle bit third fourth elements resulting array array product which minimum possible product Constraints
