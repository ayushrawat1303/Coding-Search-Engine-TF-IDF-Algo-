Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids Given cuboids where dimensions ith cuboid cuboids indexed Choose subset cuboids place them on each other You can place cuboid on cuboid if widthi widthj lengthi lengthj heighti heightj You can rearrange any cuboids dimensions by rotating it put it on another cuboid Return maximum height stacked cuboids Example Input cuboids Output Explanation Cuboid placed on bottom with side facing down with height Cuboid placed next with side facing down with height Cuboid placed next with side facing down with height total height Example Input cuboids Output Explanation You cant place any cuboids on other We choose cuboid rotate it so side facing down its height Example Input cuboids Output Explanation After rearranging cuboids you can see all cuboids have same dimension You can place side down on all cuboids so their heights maximum height stacked cuboids Constraints cuboidslength widthi lengthi heighti
