Minimum Operations Halve Array Sum You given array nums positive integers one operation you can choose any number from nums reduce it exactly half number Note you may choose this reduced number future operations Return minimum number operations reduce sum nums by least half Example Input nums Output Explanation initial sum nums equal following one ways reduce sum by least half Pick number reduce it Pick number reduce it Pick number reduce it final array with total sum sum nums has been reduced by which least half initial sum Overall operations were used so we return It can be shown we cannot reduce sum by least half less than operations Example Input nums Output Explanation initial sum nums equal following one ways reduce sum by least half Pick number reduce it Pick number reduce it Pick number reduce it final array with total sum sum nums has been reduced by which least half initial sum Overall operations were used so we return It can be shown we cannot reduce sum by least half less than operations Constraints numslength nums
