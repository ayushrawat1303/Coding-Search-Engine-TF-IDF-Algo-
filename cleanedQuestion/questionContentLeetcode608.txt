Minimize Malware Spread You given network nodes represented as adjacency matrix graph where ith node directly connected jth node if graph Some nodes initial initially infected by malware Whenever two nodes directly connected least one those two nodes infected by malware both nodes will be infected by malware This spread malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected this manner Suppose Minitial final number nodes infected with malware entire network after spread malware stops We will remove exactly one node from initial Return node if removed would minimize Minitial If multiple nodes could be removed minimize Minitial return such node with smallest index Note if node was removed from initial list infected nodes it might still be infected later due malware spread Example Input graph initial Output Example Input graph initial Output Example Input graph initial Output Constraints graphlength graphlength graph graph graph graph initiallength initial All integers initial unique
