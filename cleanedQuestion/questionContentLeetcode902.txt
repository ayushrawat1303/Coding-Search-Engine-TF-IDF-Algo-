Cells with Odd Values Matrix There matrix initialized all There also array indices where each indices represents indexed location perform some increment operations on matrix For each location indices do both following Increment all cells on row ri Increment all cells on column ci Given indices return number oddvalued cells matrix after applying increment all locations indices Example Input indices Output Explanation Initial matrix After applying first increment it becomes final matrix which contains odd numbers Example Input indices Output Explanation Final matrix There no odd numbers final matrix Constraints indiceslength ri ci Follow up Could you solve this On indiceslength time with only On extra space
