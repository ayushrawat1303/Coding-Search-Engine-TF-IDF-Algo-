Tag Validator Given string representing code snippet implement tag validator parse code return whether it valid code snippet valid if all following rules hold code must be wrapped valid closed tag Otherwise code invalid closed tag not necessarily valid has exactly following format TAG_NAMETAG_CONTENTTAG_NAME Among them TAG_NAME start tag TAG_NAME end tag TAG_NAME start end tags should be same closed tag valid if only if TAG_NAME TAG_CONTENT valid valid TAG_NAME only contain uppercase letters has length range Otherwise TAG_NAME invalid valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags cdata any characters see note EXCEPT unmatched unmatched start end tag unmatched closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME Otherwise TAG_CONTENT invalid start tag unmatched if no end tag exists with same TAG_NAME vice versa However you also need consider issue unbalanced when tags nested unmatched if you cannot find subsequent when you find all subsequent characters until next should be parsed as TAG_NAME not necessarily valid cdata has following format range CDATA_CONTENT defined as characters between CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters function cdata forbid validator parse CDATA_CONTENT so even it has some characters can be parsed as tag no matter valid invalid you should treat it as regular characters Example Input code DIVThis first line DIV Output true Explanation code wrapped closed tag DIV DIV TAG_NAME valid TAG_CONTENT consists some characters cdata Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME it should be considered as plain text not parsed as tag So TAG_CONTENT valid then code valid Thus return true Example Input code DIV DIV Output true Explanation We first separate code into start_tagtag_contentend_tag start_tag DIV end_tag DIV tag_content could also be separated into textcdatatext text cdata where CDATA_CONTENT div text reason why start_tag NOT DIV because rule reason why cdata NOT because rule Example Input code Output false Explanation Unbalanced If closed then must be unmatched vice versa Constraints codelength code consists English letters digits
