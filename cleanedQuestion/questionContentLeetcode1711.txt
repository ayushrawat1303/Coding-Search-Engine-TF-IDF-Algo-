Number Ways Reach Position After Exactly Steps You given two positive integers startPos endPos Initially you standing position startPos on infinite number line With one step you can move either one position left one position right Given positive integer return number different ways reach position endPos starting from startPos such you perform exactly steps Since answer may be very large return it modulo Two ways considered different if order steps made not exactly same Note number line includes negative integers Example Input startPos endPos Output Explanation We can reach position from exactly steps three ways It can be proven no other way possible so we return Example Input startPos endPos Output Explanation It impossible reach position from position exactly steps Constraints startPos endPos
