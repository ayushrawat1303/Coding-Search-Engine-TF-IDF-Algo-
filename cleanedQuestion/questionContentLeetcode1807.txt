Height Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries You given root binary tree with nodes Each node assigned unique value from You also given array queries size You have perform independent queries on tree where ith query you do following Remove subtree rooted node with value queries from tree It guaranteed queries will not be equal value root Return array answer size where answer height tree after performing ith query Note queries independent so tree returns its initial state after each query height tree number edges longest simple path from root some node tree Example Input root queries Output Explanation diagram above shows tree after removing subtree rooted node with value height tree path Example Input root queries Output Explanation We have following queries Removing subtree rooted node with value height tree becomes path Removing subtree rooted node with value height tree becomes path Removing subtree rooted node with value height tree becomes path Removing subtree rooted node with value height tree becomes path Constraints number nodes tree Nodeval All values tree unique querieslength minn queries queries rootval
