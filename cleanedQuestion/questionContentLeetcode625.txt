Most Stones Removed with Same Row Column On plane we place stones some integer coordinate points Each coordinate point may have most one stone stone can be removed if it shares either same row same column as another stone has not been removed Given array stones length where stones represents location ith stone return largest possible number stones can be removed Example Input stones Output Explanation One way remove stones as follows Remove stone because it shares same row as Remove stone because it shares same column as Remove stone because it shares same row as Remove stone because it shares same column as Remove stone because it shares same row as Stone cannot be removed since it does not share rowcolumn with another stone still on plane Example Input stones Output Explanation One way make moves as follows Remove stone because it shares same row as Remove stone because it shares same column as Remove stone because it shares same row as Stones cannot be removed since they do not share rowcolumn with another stone still on plane Example Input stones Output Explanation only stone on plane so you cannot remove it Constraints stoneslength xi yi No two stones same coordinate point
