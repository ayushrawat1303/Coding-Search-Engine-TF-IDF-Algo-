Longest Arithmetic Subsequence Given array nums integers return length longest arithmetic subsequence nums Note subsequence array can be derived from another array by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements sequence seq arithmetic if seq seq all same value for seqlength Example Input nums Output Explanation whole array arithmetic sequence with steps length Example Input nums Output Explanation longest arithmetic subsequence Example Input nums Output Explanation longest arithmetic subsequence Constraints numslength nums
