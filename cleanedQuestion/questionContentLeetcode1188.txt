Create Sorted Array through Instructions Given integer array instructions you asked create sorted array from elements instructions You start with empty container nums For each element from left right instructions insert it into nums cost each insertion minimum following number elements currently nums strictly less than instructions number elements currently nums strictly greater than instructions For example if inserting element into nums cost insertion min elements less than element greater than nums will become Return total cost insert all elements from instructions into nums Since answer may be large return it modulo Example Input instructions Output Explanation Begin with nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums total cost Example Input instructions Output Explanation Begin with nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums total cost Example Input instructions Output Explanation Begin with nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums Insert with cost min now nums total cost Constraints instructionslength instructions
