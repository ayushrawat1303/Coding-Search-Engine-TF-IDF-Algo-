Most Profitable Path Tree There undirected tree with nodes labeled from rooted node You given integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree every node there gate You also given array even integers amount where amount represents price needed open gate node if amount negative cash reward obtained on opening gate node otherwise game goes on as follows Initially Alice node Bob node bob every second Alice Bob each move adjacent node Alice moves towards some leaf node while Bob moves towards node For every node along their path Alice Bob either spend money open gate node accept reward Note If gate already open no price will be required nor will there be any cash reward If Alice Bob reach node simultaneously they share pricereward for opening gate there other words if price open gate then both Alice Bob pay each Similarly if reward gate both them receive each If Alice reaches leaf node she stops moving Similarly if Bob reaches node he stops moving Note these events independent each other Return maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards optimal leaf node Example Input edges bob amount Output Explanation above diagram represents given tree game goes as follows Alice initially on node Bob on node They open gates their respective nodes Alices net income now Both Alice Bob move node Since they reach here simultaneously they open gate together share reward Alices net income becomes Alice moves on node Since Bob already opened its gate Alices income remains unchanged Bob moves on node stops moving Alice moves on node opens gate there Her net income becomes Now neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves game ends It not possible for Alice get higher net income Example Input edges bob amount Output Explanation Alice follows path whereas Bob follows path Thus Alice opens gate node only Hence her net income Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi edges represents valid tree bob amountlength amount even integer range
