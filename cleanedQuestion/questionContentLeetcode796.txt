Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values Given array arr positive integers consider all binary trees such Each node has either children values arr correspond values each leaf inorder traversal tree value each nonleaf node equal product largest leaf value its left right subtree respectively Among all possible binary trees considered return smallest possible sum values each nonleaf node It guaranteed this sum fits into bit integer node leaf if only if it has zero children Example Input arr Output Explanation There two possible trees shown first has nonleaf node sum second has nonleaf node sum Example Input arr Output Constraints arrlength arr It guaranteed answer fits into bit signed integer ie it less than
