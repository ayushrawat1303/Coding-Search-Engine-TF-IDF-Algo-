Satisfiability Equality Equations You given array strings equations represent relationships between variables where each string equations length takes one two different forms xiyi xiyiHere xi yi lowercase letters not necessarily different represent oneletter variable names Return true if it possible assign integers variable names so as satisfy all given equations false otherwise Example Input equations Output false Explanation If we assign say then first equation satisfied but not second There no way assign variables satisfy both equations Example Input equations Output true Explanation We could assign satisfy both equations Constraints equationslength equationslength equations lowercase letter equations either equations equations lowercase letter
