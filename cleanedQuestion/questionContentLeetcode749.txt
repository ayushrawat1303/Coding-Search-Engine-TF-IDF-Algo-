Clumsy Factorial factorial positive integer product all positive integers less than equal For example factorial We make clumsy factorial using integers decreasing order by swapping out multiply operations for fixed rotation operations with multiply divide add subtract this order For example clumsy However these operations still applied using usual order operations arithmetic We do all multiplication division steps before any addition subtraction steps multiplication division steps processed left right Additionally division we use floor division such Given integer return clumsy factorial Example Input Output Explanation Example Input Output Explanation Constraints
