String Compression Given array characters chars compress it using following algorithm Begin with empty string For each group consecutive repeating characters chars If groups length append character Otherwise append character followed by groups length compressed string should not be returned separately but instead be stored input character array chars Note group lengths longer will be split into multiple characters chars After you done modifying input array return new length array You must write algorithm uses only constant extra space Example Input chars Output Return first characters input array should be Explanation groups aa bb ccc This compresses abc Example Input chars Output Return first character input array should be Explanation only group which remains uncompressed since its single character Example Input chars Output Return first characters input array should be Explanation groups bbbbbbbbbbbb This compresses ab Constraints charslength chars lowercase English letter uppercase English letter digit symbol
