Sum Subsequence Widths width sequence difference between maximum minimum elements sequence Given array integers nums return sum widths all nonempty subsequences nums Since answer may be very large return it modulo subsequence sequence can be derived from array by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements For example subsequence array Example Input nums Output Explanation subsequences corresponding widths sum these widths Example Input nums Output Constraints numslength nums
