Contain Virus virus spreading rapidly your task quarantine infected area by installing walls world modeled as binary grid isInfected where isInfected represents uninfected cells isInfected represents cells contaminated with virus wall only one wall can be installed between any two directionally adjacent cells on shared boundary Every night virus spreads all neighboring cells all four directions unless blocked by wall Resources limited Each day you can install walls around only one region ie affected area continuous block infected cells threatens most uninfected cells following night There will never be tie Return number walls used quarantine all infected regions If world will become fully infected return number walls used Example Input isInfected Output Explanation There contaminated regions On first day add walls quarantine viral region on left board after virus spreads On second day add walls quarantine viral region on right virus fully contained Example Input isInfected Output Explanation Even though there only one cell saved there walls built Notice walls only built on shared boundary two different cells Example Input isInfected Output Explanation region on left only builds two new walls Constraints isInfectedlength isInfectedlength isInfected either There always contiguous viral region throughout described process will infect strictly more uncontaminated squares next round
