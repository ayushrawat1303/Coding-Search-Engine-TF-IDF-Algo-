Smallest Missing Genetic Value Each Subtree There family tree rooted consisting nodes numbered You given indexed integer array parents where parents parent for node Since node root parents There genetic values each represented by integer inclusive range You given indexed integer array nums where nums distinct genetic value for node Return array ans length where ans smallest genetic value missing from subtree rooted node subtree rooted node contains node all its descendant nodes Example Input parents nums Output Explanation answer for each subtree calculated as follows subtree contains nodes with values smallest missing value subtree contains only node with value smallest missing value subtree contains nodes with values smallest missing value subtree contains only node with value smallest missing value Example Input parents nums Output Explanation answer for each subtree calculated as follows subtree contains nodes with values smallest missing value subtree contains nodes with values smallest missing value subtree contains only node with value smallest missing value subtree contains nodes with values smallest missing value subtree contains only node with value smallest missing value subtree contains only node with value smallest missing value Example Input parents nums Output Explanation value missing from all subtrees Constraints parentslength numslength parents for parents parents represents valid tree nums Each nums distinct
