Event Emitter Design EventEmitter class This interface similar but with some differences one found Nodejs Event Target interface DOM EventEmitter should allow for subscribing events emitting them Your EventEmitter class should have following two methods subscribe This method takes two arguments name event as string callback function This callback function will later be called when event emitted event should be able have multiple listeners for same event When emitting event with multiple callbacks each should be called order which they were subscribed array results should be returned You can assume no callbacks passed subscribe referentially identical subscribe method should also return object with unsubscribe method enables user unsubscribe When it called callback should be removed from list subscriptions undefined should be returned emit This method takes two arguments name event as string optional array arguments will be passed callbacks If there no callbacks subscribed given event return empty array Otherwise return array results all callback calls order they were subscribed Example Input actions values Output Explanation const emitter new EventEmitter emitteremitfirstEvent no callback subscribed yet emittersubscribefirstEvent function cb return emittersubscribefirstEvent function cb return emitteremitfirstEvent returns output cb cb Example Input actions values Output Explanation Note emit method should be able accept OPTIONAL array arguments const emitter new EventEmitter emittersubscribefirstEvent function cbargs return argsjoin emitteremitfirstEvent emitteremitfirstEvent Example Input actions values Output Explanation const emitter new EventEmitter const sub emittersubscribefirstEvent args argsjoin emitteremitfirstEvent subunsubscribe undefined emitteremitfirstEvent there no subscriptions Constraints actionslength valueslength actionslength All test cases valid eg you dont need handle scenarios when unsubscribing from nonexisting subscription There only different actions EventEmitter emit subscribe unsubscribe EventEmitter action doesnt take any arguments emit action takes between either arguments first argument name event we want emit nd argument passed callback functions subscribe action takes arguments where first one event name second callback function unsubscribe action takes one argument which indexed order subscription made before
