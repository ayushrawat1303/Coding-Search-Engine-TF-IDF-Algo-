Flatten Deeply Nested Array Given multidimensional array arr depth return flattened version array multidimensional array recursive data structure contains integers other multidimensional arrays flattened array version array with some all subarrays removed replaced with actual elements subarray This flattening operation should only be done if current depth nesting less than depth elements first array considered be Please solve it without builtin Arrayflat method Example Input arr Output Explanation Passing depth will always result original array This because smallest possible depth subarray not less than Thus no subarray should be flattened Example Input arr Output Explanation subarrays starting with all flattened This because their depth less than However remains unflattened because its depth Example Input arr Output Explanation maximum depth any subarray Thus all them flattened Constraints count numbers arr count subarrays arr maxDepth each number
