Find Replace String You given indexed string you must perform replacement operations on replacement operations given as three indexed parallel arrays indices sources targets all length complete ith replacement operation Check if substring sources occurs index indices original string If it does not occur do nothing Otherwise if it does occur replace substring with targets For example if abcd indices sources ab targets eee then result this replacement will be eeecd All replacement operations must occur simultaneously meaning replacement operations should not affect indexing each other testcases will be generated such replacements will not overlap For example testcase with abc indices sources will not be generated because ab bc replacements overlap Return resulting string after performing all replacement operations on substring contiguous sequence characters string Example Input abcd indices sources targets Output eeebffff Explanation occurs index so we replace it with eee cd occurs index so we replace it with ffff Example Input abcd indices sources targets Output eeecd Explanation ab occurs index so we replace it with eee ec does not occur index so we do nothing Constraints slength indiceslength sourceslength targetslength indexes slength sourceslength targetslength consists only lowercase English letters sources targets consist only lowercase English letters
