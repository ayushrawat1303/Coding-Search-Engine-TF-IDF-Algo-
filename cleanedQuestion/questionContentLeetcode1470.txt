Detect Squares You given stream points on XY plane Design algorithm Adds new points from stream into data structure Duplicate points allowed should be treated as different points Given query point counts number ways choose three points from data structure such three points query point form axisaligned square with positive area axisaligned square square whose edges all same length either parallel perpendicular xaxis yaxis Implement DetectSquares class DetectSquares Initializes object with empty data structure void addint point Adds new point point data structure int countint point Counts number ways form axisaligned squares with point point as described above Example Input Output Explanation DetectSquares detectSquares new DetectSquares detectSquaresadd detectSquaresadd detectSquaresadd detectSquarescount return You can choose first second third points detectSquarescount return query point cannot form square with any points data structure detectSquaresadd Adding duplicate points allowed detectSquarescount return You can choose first second third points first third fourth points Constraints pointlength most calls total will be made add count
