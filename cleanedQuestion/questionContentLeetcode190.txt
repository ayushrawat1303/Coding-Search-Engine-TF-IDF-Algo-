Serialize Deserialize Binary Tree Serialization process converting data structure object into sequence bits so it can be stored file memory buffer transmitted across network connection link be reconstructed later same another computer environment Design algorithm serialize deserialize binary tree There no restriction on how your serializationdeserialization algorithm should work You just need ensure binary tree can be serialized string this string can be deserialized original tree structure Clarification inputoutput format same as how LeetCode serializes binary tree You do not necessarily need follow this format so please be creative come up with different approaches yourself Example Input root Output Example Input root Output Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval
