Add Edges Make Degrees All Nodes Even There undirected graph consisting nodes numbered from You given integer array edges where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi graph can be disconnected You can add most two additional edges possibly none this graph so there no repeated edges no selfloops Return true if it possible make degree each node graph even otherwise return false degree node number edges connected it Example Input edges Output true Explanation above diagram shows valid way adding edge Every node resulting graph connected even number edges Example Input edges Output true Explanation above diagram shows valid way adding two edges Example Input edges Output false Explanation It not possible obtain valid graph with adding most edges Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi There no repeated edges
