Number Ways Reorder Array Get Same BST Given array nums represents permutation integers from We going construct binary search tree BST by inserting elements nums order into initially empty BST Find number different ways reorder nums so constructed BST identical formed from original array nums For example given nums we will have as root as left child as right child array also yields same BST but yields different BST Return number ways reorder nums such BST formed identical original BST formed from nums Since answer may be very large return it modulo Example Input nums Output Explanation We can reorder nums be which will yield same BST There no other ways reorder nums which will yield same BST Example Input nums Output Explanation following arrays will yield same BST Example Input nums Output Explanation There no other orderings nums will yield same BST Constraints numslength nums numslength All integers nums distinct
