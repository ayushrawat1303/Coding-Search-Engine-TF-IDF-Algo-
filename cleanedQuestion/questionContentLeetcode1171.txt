Remove Max Number Edges Keep Graph Fully Traversable Alice Bob have undirected graph nodes three types edges Type Can be traversed by Alice only Type Can be traversed by Bob only Type Can be traversed by both Alice Bob Given array edges where edges represents bidirectional edge type typei between nodes ui vi find maximum number edges you can remove so after removing edges graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice Bob graph fully traversed by Alice Bob if starting from any node they can reach all other nodes Return maximum number edges you can remove return if Alice Bob cannot fully traverse graph Example Input edges Output Explanation If we remove edges graph will still be fully traversable by Alice Bob Removing any additional edge will not make it so So maximum number edges we can remove Example Input edges Output Explanation Notice removing any edge will not make graph fully traversable by Alice Bob Example Input edges Output Explanation current graph Alice cannot reach node from other nodes Likewise Bob cannot reach Therefore its impossible make graph fully traversable Constraints edgeslength min edgeslength typei ui vi All tuples typei ui vi distinct
