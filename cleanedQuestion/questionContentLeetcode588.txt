LeafSimilar Trees Consider all leaves binary tree from left right order values those leaves form leaf value sequence For example given tree above leaf value sequence Two binary trees considered leafsimilar if their leaf value sequence same Return true if only if two given trees with head nodes root root leafsimilar Example Input root root Output true Example Input root root Output false Constraints number nodes each tree will be range Both given trees will have values range
