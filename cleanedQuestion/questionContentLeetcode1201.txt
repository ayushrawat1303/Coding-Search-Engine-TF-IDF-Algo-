Furthest Building You Can Reach You given integer array heights representing heights buildings some bricks some ladders You start your journey from building move next building by possibly using bricks ladders While moving from building building indexed If current buildings height greater than equal next buildings height you do not need ladder bricks If current buildings height less than next buildings height you can either use one ladder bricks Return furthest building index indexed you can reach if you use given ladders bricks optimally Example Input heights bricks ladders Output Explanation Starting building you can follow these steps Go building without using ladders nor bricks since Go building using bricks You must use either bricks ladders because Go building without using ladders nor bricks since Go building using your only ladder You must use either bricks ladders because It impossible go beyond building because you do not have any more bricks ladders Example Input heights bricks ladders Output Example Input heights bricks ladders Output Constraints heightslength heights bricks ladders heightslength
