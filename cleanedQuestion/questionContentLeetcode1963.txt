Minimize Total Price Trips There exists undirected unrooted tree with nodes indexed from You given integer integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree Each node has associated price You given integer array price where price price ith node price sum given path sum prices all nodes lying on path Additionally you given integer array trips where trips indicates you start ith trip from node starti travel node endi by any path you like Before performing your first trip you can choose some nonadjacent nodes halve prices Return minimum total price sum perform all given trips Example Input edges price trips Output Explanation diagram above denotes tree after rooting it node first part shows initial tree second part shows tree after choosing nodes making their price half For st trip we choose path price sum path For nd trip we choose path price sum path For rd trip we choose path price sum path total price sum all trips It can be proven minimum answer we can achieve Example Input edges price trips Output Explanation diagram above denotes tree after rooting it node first part shows initial tree second part shows tree after choosing node making its price half For st trip we choose path price sum path total price sum all trips It can be proven minimum answer we can achieve Constraints edgeslength ai bi edges represents valid tree pricelength price even integer price tripslength starti endi
