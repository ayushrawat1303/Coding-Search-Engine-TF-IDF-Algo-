Car Fleet There cars going same destination along onelane road destination target miles away You given two integer array position speed both length where position position ith car speed speed ith car miles per hour car can never pass another car ahead it but it can catch up it drive bumper bumper same speed faster car will slow down match slower cars speed distance between these two cars ignored ie they assumed have same position car fleet some nonempty set cars driving same position same speed Note single car also car fleet If car catches up car fleet right destination point it will still be considered as one car fleet Return number car fleets will arrive destination Example Input target position speed Output Explanation cars starting speed speed become fleet meeting each other car starting does not catch up any other car so it fleet by itself cars starting speed speed become fleet meeting each other fleet moves speed until it reaches target Note no other cars meet these fleets before destination so answer Example Input target position speed Output Explanation There only one car hence there only one fleet Example Input target position speed Output Explanation cars starting speed speed become fleet meeting each other fleet moves speed Then fleet speed car starting speed become one fleet meeting each other fleet moves speed until it reaches target Constraints positionlength speedlength target position target All values position unique speed
