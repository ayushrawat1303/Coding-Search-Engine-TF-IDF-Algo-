Find Critical PseudoCritical Edges Minimum Spanning Tree Given weighted undirected connected graph with vertices numbered from array edges where edges represents bidirectional weighted edge between nodes ai bi minimum spanning tree MST subset graphs edges connects all vertices without cycles with minimum possible total edge weight Find all critical pseudocritical edges given graphs minimum spanning tree MST MST edge whose deletion from graph would cause MST weight increase called critical edge On other hand pseudocritical edge which can appear some MSTs but not all Note you can return indices edges any order Example Input edges Output Explanation figure above describes graph following figure shows all possible MSTs Notice two edges appear all MSTs therefore they critical edges so we return them first list output edges only part some MSTs therefore they considered pseudocritical edges We add them second list output Example Input edges Output Explanation We can observe since all edges have equal weight choosing any edges from given will yield MST Therefore all edges pseudocritical Constraints edgeslength min edgeslength ai bi weighti All pairs ai bi distinct
