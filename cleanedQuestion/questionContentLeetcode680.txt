Delete Columns Make Sorted III You given array strings strs all same length We may choose any deletion indices we delete all characters those indices for each string For example if we have strs deletion indices then final array after deletions Suppose we chose set deletion indices answer such after deletions final array has every string row lexicographic order ie strs strs strslength strs strs strslength so on Return minimum possible value answerlength Example Input strs Output Explanation After deleting columns final array strs Both these rows individually lexicographic order ie strs strs strs strs Note strs strs array strs not necessarily lexicographic order Example Input strs Output Explanation If we delete less than columns only row will not be lexicographically sorted Example Input strs Output Explanation All rows already lexicographically sorted Constraints strslength strslength strs consists lowercase English letters
