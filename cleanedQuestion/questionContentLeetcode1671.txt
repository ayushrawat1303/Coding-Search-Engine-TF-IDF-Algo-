Minimum Sum Squared Difference You given two positive indexed integer arrays nums nums both length sum squared difference arrays nums nums defined as sum nums nums for each You also given two positive integers You can modify any elements nums by most times Similarly you can modify any elements nums by most times Return minimum sum squared difference after modifying array nums most times modifying array nums most times Note You allowed modify array elements become negative integers Example Input nums nums Output Explanation elements nums nums cannot be modified because sum square difference will be Example Input nums nums Output Explanation One way obtain minimum sum square difference Increase nums once Increase nums once minimum sum square difference will be Note there other ways obtain minimum sum square difference but there no way obtain sum smaller than Constraints numslength numslength nums nums
