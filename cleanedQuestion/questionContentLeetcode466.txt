Rotated Digits integer good if after rotating each digit individually by degrees we get valid number different from Each digit must be rotated we cannot choose leave it alone number valid if each digit remains digit after rotation For example rotate themselves rotate each other this case they rotated different direction other words gets mirrored rotate each other rest numbers do not rotate any other number become invalid Given integer return number good integers range Example Input Output Explanation There four good numbers range Note not good numbers since they remain unchanged after rotating Example Input Output Example Input Output Constraints
