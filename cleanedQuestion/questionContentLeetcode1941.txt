Find Maximum Divisibility Score You given two indexed integer arrays nums divisors divisibility score divisors number indices such nums divisible by divisors Return integer divisors with maximum divisibility score If there more than one integer with maximum score return minimum them Example Input nums divisors Output Explanation divisibility score for every element divisors divisibility score divisors since no number nums divisible by divisibility score divisors since nums divisible by divisibility score divisors since nums nums nums divisible by Since divisors has maximum divisibility score we return it Example Input nums divisors Output Explanation divisibility score for every element divisors divisibility score divisors since nums nums divisible by divisibility score divisors since nums nums divisible by divisibility score divisors since nums nums divisible by Since divisors divisors divisors all have maximum divisibility score we return minimum them ie divisors Example Input nums divisors Output Explanation divisibility score for every element divisors divisibility score divisors since no number nums divisible by divisibility score divisors since no number nums divisible by Since divisors divisors both have maximum divisibility score we return minimum them ie divisors Constraints numslength divisorslength nums divisors
