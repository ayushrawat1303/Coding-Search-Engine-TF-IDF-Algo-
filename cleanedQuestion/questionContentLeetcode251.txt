Minimum Number Arrows Burst Balloons There some spherical balloons taped onto flat wall represents XYplane balloons represented as integer array points where points denotes balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart xend You do not know exact ycoordinates balloons Arrows can be shot up directly vertically positive ydirection from different points along xaxis balloon with xstart xend burst by arrow shot if xstart xend There no limit number arrows can be shot shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely bursting any balloons its path Given array points return minimum number arrows must be shot burst all balloons Example Input points Output Explanation balloons can be burst by arrows Shoot arrow bursting balloons Shoot arrow bursting balloons Example Input points Output Explanation One arrow needs be shot for each balloon for total arrows Example Input points Output Explanation balloons can be burst by arrows Shoot arrow bursting balloons Shoot arrow bursting balloons Constraints pointslength pointslength xstart xend
