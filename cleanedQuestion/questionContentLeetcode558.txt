Walking Robot Simulation robot on infinite XYplane starts point facing north robot can receive sequence these three possible types commands Turn left degrees Turn right degrees Move forward units one unit time Some grid squares obstacles ith obstacle grid point obstacles xi yi If robot runs into obstacle then it will instead stay its current location move on next command Return maximum Euclidean distance robot ever gets from origin squared ie if distance return Note North means direction East means direction South means direction West means direction Example Input commands obstacles Output Explanation robot starts Move north units Turn right Move east units furthest point robot ever gets from origin which squared units away Example Input commands obstacles Output Explanation robot starts Move north units Turn right Move east unit get blocked by obstacle robot Turn left Move north units furthest point robot ever gets from origin which squared units away Example Input commands obstacles Output Explanation robot starts Move north units Turn right Turn right Move south units furthest point robot ever gets from origin which squared units away Constraints commandslength commands either integer range obstacleslength xi yi answer guaranteed be less than
