Toeplitz Matrix Given matrix return true if matrix Toeplitz Otherwise return false matrix Toeplitz if every diagonal from topleft bottomright has same elements Example Input matrix Output true Explanation above grid diagonals each diagonal all elements same so answer True Example Input matrix Output false Explanation diagonal has different elements Constraints matrixlength matrixlength matrix Follow up What if matrix stored on disk memory limited such you can only load most one row matrix into memory once What if matrix so large you can only load up partial row into memory once
