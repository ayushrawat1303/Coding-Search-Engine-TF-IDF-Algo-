Longest Increasing Subsequence II You given integer array nums integer Find longest subsequence nums meets following requirements subsequence strictly increasing difference between adjacent elements subsequence most Return length longest subsequence meets requirements subsequence array can be derived from another array by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements Example Input nums Output Explanation longest subsequence meets requirements subsequence has length so we return Note subsequence does not meet requirements because larger than Example Input nums Output Explanation longest subsequence meets requirements subsequence has length so we return Example Input nums Output Explanation longest subsequence meets requirements subsequence has length so we return Constraints numslength nums
