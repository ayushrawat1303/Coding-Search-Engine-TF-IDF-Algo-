Grid Game You given indexed array grid size where grid represents number points position on matrix Two robots playing game on this matrix Both robots initially start want reach Each robot may only move right down start game first robot moves from collecting all points from cells on its path For all cells traversed on path grid set Then second robot moves from collecting points on its path Note their paths may intersect with one another first robot wants minimize number points collected by second robot contrast second robot wants maximize number points it collects If both robots play optimally return number points collected by second robot Example Input grid Output Explanation optimal path taken by first robot shown red optimal path taken by second robot shown blue cells visited by first robot set second robot will collect points Example Input grid Output Explanation optimal path taken by first robot shown red optimal path taken by second robot shown blue cells visited by first robot set second robot will collect points Example Input grid Output Explanation optimal path taken by first robot shown red optimal path taken by second robot shown blue cells visited by first robot set second robot will collect points Constraints gridlength gridlength grid
