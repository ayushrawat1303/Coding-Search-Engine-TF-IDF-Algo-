Time Based KeyValue Store Design timebased keyvalue data structure can store multiple values for same key different time stamps retrieve keys value certain timestamp Implement TimeMap class TimeMap Initializes object data structure void setString key String value int timestamp Stores key key with value value given time timestamp String getString key int timestamp Returns value such set was called previously with timestamp_prev timestamp If there multiple such values it returns value associated with largest timestamp_prev If there no values it returns Example Input Output Explanation TimeMap timeMap new TimeMap timeMapsetfoo bar store key foo value bar along with timestamp timeMapgetfoo return bar timeMapgetfoo return bar since there no value corresponding foo timestamp timestamp then only value timestamp bar timeMapsetfoo bar store key foo value bar along with timestamp timeMapgetfoo return bar timeMapgetfoo return bar Constraints keylength valuelength key value consist lowercase English letters digits timestamp All timestamps timestamp set strictly increasing most calls will be made set get
