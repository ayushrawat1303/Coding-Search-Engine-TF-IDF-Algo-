Smallest Rotation with Highest Score You given array nums You can rotate it by nonnegative integer so array becomes nums nums nums nums nums Afterward any entries less than equal their index worth one point For example if we have nums we rotate by it becomes This worth points because Return rotation index corresponds highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it If there multiple answers return smallest such index Example Input nums Output Explanation Scores for each listed below nums score nums score nums score nums score nums score So we should choose which has highest score Example Input nums Output Explanation nums will always have points no matter how it shifts So we will choose smallest which Constraints numslength nums numslength
