Minimize Deviation Array You given array nums positive integers You can perform two types operations on any element array any number times If element even divide it by For example if array then you can do this operation on last element array will be If element odd multiply it by For example if array then you can do this operation on first element array will be deviation array maximum difference between any two elements array Return minimum deviation array can have after performing some number operations Example Input nums Output Explanation You can transform array then then deviation will be Example Input nums Output Explanation You can transform array after two operations then deviation will be Example Input nums Output Constraints numslength nums
