Find KSum Array You given integer array nums positive integer You can choose any subsequence array sum all its elements together We define KSum array as kth largest subsequence sum can be obtained not necessarily distinct Return KSum array subsequence array can be derived from another array by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements Note empty subsequence considered have sum Example Input nums Output Explanation All possible subsequence sums we can obtain following sorted decreasing order Sum array Example Input nums Output Explanation Sum array Constraints numslength nums min
