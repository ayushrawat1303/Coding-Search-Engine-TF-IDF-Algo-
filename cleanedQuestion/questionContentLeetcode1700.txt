Maximum Rows Covered by Columns You given indexed binary matrix matrix integer numSelect which denotes number distinct columns you must select from matrix Let us consider cnumSelect as set columns selected by you row row covered by if For each cell matrix col where matrix col present No cell row has value You need choose numSelect columns such number rows covered maximized Return maximum number rows can be covered by set numSelect columns Example Input matrix numSelect Output Explanation One possible way cover rows shown diagram above We choose Row covered because it has no occurrences Row covered because columns with value ie present Row not covered because matrix but not present Row covered because matrix present Thus we can cover three rows Note will also cover rows but it can be shown no more than three rows can be covered Example Input matrix numSelect Output Explanation Selecting only column will result both rows being covered since entire matrix selected Therefore we return Constraints matrixlength matrixlength matrix either numSelect
