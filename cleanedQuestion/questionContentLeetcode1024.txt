Minimum Subsequence NonIncreasing Order Given array nums obtain subsequence array whose sum elements strictly greater than sum non included elements such subsequence If there multiple solutions return subsequence with minimum size if there still exist multiple solutions return subsequence with maximum total sum all its elements subsequence array can be obtained by erasing some possibly zero elements from array Note solution with given constraints guaranteed be unique Also return answer sorted nonincreasing order Example Input nums Output Explanation subsequences minimal such sum their elements strictly greater than sum elements not included However subsequence has maximum total sum its elements Example Input nums Output Explanation subsequence has sum its elements equal which not strictly greater than sum elements not included Therefore subsequence minimal satisfying conditions Note subsequence has be returned nondecreasing order Constraints numslength nums
