Shortest Cycle Graph There bidirectional graph with vertices where each vertex labeled from edges graph represented by given integer array edges where edges denotes edge between vertex ui vertex vi Every vertex pair connected by most one edge no vertex has edge itself Return length shortest cycle graph If no cycle exists return cycle path starts ends same node each edge path used only once Example Input edges Output Explanation cycle with smallest length Example Input edges Output Explanation There no cycles this graph Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ui vi ui vi There no repeated edges
