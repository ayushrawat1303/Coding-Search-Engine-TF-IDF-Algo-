Find Closest Node Given Two Nodes You given directed graph nodes numbered from where each node has most one outgoing edge graph represented with given indexed array edges size indicating there directed edge from node node edges If there no outgoing edge from then edges You also given two integers node node Return index node can be reached from both node node such maximum between distance from node node from node node minimized If there multiple answers return node with smallest index if no possible answer exists return Note edges may contain cycles Example Input edges node node Output Explanation distance from node node distance from node node maximum those two distances It can be proven we cannot get node with smaller maximum distance than so we return node Example Input edges node node Output Explanation distance from node node distance from node itself maximum those two distances It can be proven we cannot get node with smaller maximum distance than so we return node Constraints edgeslength edges edges node node
