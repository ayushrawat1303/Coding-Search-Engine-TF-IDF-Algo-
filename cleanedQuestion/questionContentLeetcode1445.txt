Find if Path Exists Graph There bidirectional graph with vertices where each vertex labeled from inclusive edges graph represented as integer array edges where each edges denotes bidirectional edge between vertex ui vertex vi Every vertex pair connected by most one edge no vertex has edge itself You want determine if there valid path exists from vertex source vertex destination Given edges integers source destination return true if there valid path from source destination false otherwise Example Input edges source destination Output true Explanation There two paths from vertex vertex Example Input edges source destination Output false Explanation There no path from vertex vertex Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ui vi ui vi source destination There no duplicate edges There no self edges
