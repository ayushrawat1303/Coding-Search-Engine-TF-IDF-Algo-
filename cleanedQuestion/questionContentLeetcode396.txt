Remove Comments Given program remove comments from it program source array strings source where source ith line source code This represents result splitting original source code string by newline character there two types comments line comments block comments string denotes line comment which represents it rest characters right it same line should be ignored string denotes block comment which represents all characters until next nonoverlapping occurrence should be ignored Here occurrences happen reading order line by line from left right be clear string does not yet end block comment as ending would be overlapping beginning first effective comment takes precedence over others For example if string occurs block comment it ignored Similarly if string occurs line block comment it also ignored If certain line code empty after removing comments you must not output line each string answer list will be nonempty There will be no control characters single quote double quote characters For example source string Not comment will not be test case Also nothing else such as defines macros will interfere with comments It guaranteed every open block comment will eventually be closed so outside line block comment always starts new comment Finally implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments Please see examples below for details After removing comments from source code return source code same format Example Input source Output Explanation line by line code visualized as below Test program int main variable declaration int This test multiline comment for testing string denotes block comment including line lines string denotes line as comments line by line output code visualized as below int main int Example Input source Output Explanation original source string acommentnlinenmore_commentb where we have bolded newline characters After deletion implicit newline characters deleted leaving string ab which when delimited by newline characters becomes Constraints sourcelength sourcelength source consists printable ASCII characters Every open block comment eventually closed There no singlequote doublequote input
