Cat Mouse game on undirected graph played by two players Mouse Cat who alternate turns graph given as follows graph list all nodes such ab edge graph mouse starts node goes first cat starts node goes second there hole node During each players turn they must travel along one edge graph meets where they For example if Mouse node it must travel any node graph Additionally it not allowed for Cat travel Hole node Then game can end three ways If ever Cat occupies same node as Mouse Cat wins If ever Mouse reaches Hole Mouse wins If ever position repeated ie players same position as previous turn it same players turn move game draw Given graph assuming both players play optimally return if mouse wins game if cat wins game if game draw Example Input graph Output Example Input graph Output Constraints graphlength graphlength graphlength graph graphlength graph graph unique mouse cat can always move
