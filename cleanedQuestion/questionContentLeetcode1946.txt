Cache With Time Limit Write class allows getting setting keyvalue pairs however time until expiration associated with each key class has three public methods setkey value duration accepts integer key integer value duration milliseconds Once duration has elapsed key should be inaccessible method should return true if same unexpired key already exists false otherwise Both value duration should be overwritten if key already exists getkey if unexpired key exists it should return associated value Otherwise it should return count returns count unexpired keys Example Input Output Explanation cache constructed keyvalue pair added with time limit ms value doesnt exist so false returned key requested value returned count called there one active key cache key expires get called but returned because cache empty Example Input Output Explanation cache constructed keyvalue pair added with time limit ms value doesnt exist so false returned keyvalue pair added with time limit ms nonexpired value already existed so true returned old value was overwritten get called which returned get called which returned key expires get called but cache empty so returned count returns because cache empty Constraints key value duration total method calls will not exceed
