Number Good Subsets You given integer array nums We call subset nums good if its product can be represented as product one more distinct prime numbers For example if nums good subsets with products respectively not good subsets with products respectively Return number different good subsets nums modulo subset nums any array can be obtained by deleting some possibly none all elements from nums Two subsets different if only if chosen indices delete different Example Input nums Output Explanation good subsets product which product distinct prime product which product distinct primes product which product distinct prime product which product distinct prime product which product distinct primes product which product distinct prime Example Input nums Output Explanation good subsets product which product distinct prime product which product distinct primes product which product distinct primes product which product distinct prime product which product distinct primes Constraints numslength nums
