Pyramid Transition Matrix You stacking blocks form pyramid Each block has color which represented by single letter Each row blocks contains one less block than row beneath it centered on top make pyramid aesthetically pleasing there only specific triangular patterns allowed triangular pattern consists single block stacked on top two blocks patterns given as list threeletter strings allowed where first two characters pattern represent left right bottom blocks respectively third character top block For example ABC represents triangular pattern with block stacked on top left right block Note this different from BAC where on left bottom on right bottom You start with bottom row blocks bottom given as single string you must use as base pyramid Given bottom allowed return true if you can build pyramid all way top such every triangular pattern pyramid allowed false otherwise Example Input bottom BCD allowed Output true Explanation allowed triangular patterns shown on right Starting from bottom level we can build CE on level then build on level There three triangular patterns pyramid which BCC CDE CEA All allowed Example Input bottom AAAA allowed Output false Explanation allowed triangular patterns shown on right Starting from bottom level there multiple ways build level but trying all possibilites you will get always stuck before building level Constraints bottomlength allowedlength allowedlength letters all input strings from set All values allowed unique
