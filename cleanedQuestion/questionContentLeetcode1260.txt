Average Time Process per Machine SQL Schema Table Activity Column Name Type machine_id int process_id int activity_type enum timestamp float table shows user activities for factory website machine_id process_id activity_type primary key this table machine_id ID machine process_id ID process running on machine with ID machine_id activity_type ENUM type start end timestamp float representing current time seconds start means machine starts process given timestamp end means machine ends process given timestamp start timestamp will always be before end timestamp for every machine_id process_id pair There factory website has several machines each running same number processes Write SQL query find average time each machine takes complete process time complete process end timestamp minus start timestamp average time calculated by total time complete every process on machine divided by number processes were run resulting table should have machine_id along with average time as processing_time which should be rounded decimal places Return result table any order query result format following example Example Input Activity table machine_id process_id activity_type timestamp start end start end start end start end start end start end Output machine_id processing_time Explanation There machines running processes each Machine average time Machine average time Machine average time
