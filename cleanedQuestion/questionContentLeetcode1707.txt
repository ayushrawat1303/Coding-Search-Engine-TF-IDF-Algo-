Minimum Recolors Get Consecutive Black Blocks You given indexed string blocks length where blocks either representing color ith block characters denote colors white black respectively You also given integer which desired number consecutive black blocks one operation you can recolor white block such it becomes black block Return minimum number operations needed such there least one occurrence consecutive black blocks Example Input blocks WBBWWBBWBW Output Explanation One way achieve consecutive black blocks recolor th rd th blocks so blocks BBBBBBBWBW It can be shown there no way achieve consecutive black blocks less than operations Therefore we return Example Input blocks WBWBBBW Output Explanation No changes need be made since consecutive black blocks already exist Therefore we return Constraints blockslength blocks either
