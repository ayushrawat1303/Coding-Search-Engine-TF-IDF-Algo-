Minimum Bit Flips Convert Number bit flip number choosing bit binary representation flipping it from either For example for binary representation we may choose any bit including any leading zeros not shown flip it We can flip first bit from right get flip second bit from right get flip fifth bit from right leading zero get etc Given two integers start goal return minimum number bit flips convert start goal Example Input start goal Output Explanation binary representation respectively We can convert steps Flip first bit from right Flip third bit from right Flip fourth bit from right It can be shown we cannot convert less than steps Hence we return Example Input start goal Output Explanation binary representation respectively We can convert steps Flip first bit from right Flip second bit from right Flip third bit from right It can be shown we cannot convert less than steps Hence we return Constraints start goal
