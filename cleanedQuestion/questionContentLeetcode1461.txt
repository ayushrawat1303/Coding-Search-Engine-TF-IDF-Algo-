Find Longest Valid Obstacle Course Each Position You want build some obstacle courses You given indexed integer array obstacles length where obstacles describes height ith obstacle For every index between inclusive find length longest obstacle course obstacles such You choose any number obstacles between inclusive You must include ith obstacle course You must put chosen obstacles same order as they appear obstacles Every obstacle except first taller than same height as obstacle immediately before it Return array ans length where ans length longest obstacle course for index as described above Example Input obstacles Output Explanation longest valid obstacle course each position has length has length has length has length Example Input obstacles Output Explanation longest valid obstacle course each position has length has length has length Example Input obstacles Output Explanation longest valid obstacle course each position has length has length has length also valid has length also valid has length also valid has length Constraints obstacleslength obstacles
