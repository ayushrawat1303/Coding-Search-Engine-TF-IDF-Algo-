Count Subarrays With Score Less Than score array defined as product its sum its length For example score Given positive integer array nums integer return number nonempty subarrays nums whose score strictly less than subarray contiguous sequence elements within array Example Input nums Output Explanation subarrays having scores less than with score with score with score with score with score with score Note subarrays such as not considered because their scores respectively while we need scores strictly less than Example Input nums Output Explanation Every subarray except has score less than has score which greater than Thus there subarrays having scores less than Constraints numslength nums
