Longest Square Streak Array You given integer array nums subsequence nums called square streak if length subsequence least after sorting subsequence each element except first element square previous number Return length longest square streak nums return if there no square streak subsequence array can be derived from another array by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements Example Input nums Output Explanation Choose subsequence After sorting it it becomes Therefore square streak It can be shown every subsequence length not square streak Example Input nums Output Explanation There no square streak nums so return Constraints numslength nums
