Maximize Number Subsequences String You given indexed string text another indexed string pattern length both which consist only lowercase English letters You can add either pattern pattern anywhere text exactly once Note character can be added even beginning end text Return maximum number times pattern can occur as subsequence modified text subsequence string can be derived from another string by deleting some no characters without changing order remaining characters Example Input text abdcdbc pattern ac Output Explanation If we add pattern between text text we get abadcdbc Now number times ac occurs as subsequence Some other strings which have subsequences ac after adding character text aabdcdbc abdacdbc However strings such as abdcadbc abdccdbc abdcdbcc although obtainable have only subsequences ac thus suboptimal It can be shown it not possible get more than subsequences ac by adding only one character Example Input text aabb pattern ab Output Explanation Some strings which can be obtained from text have subsequences ab aaabb aaabb aabbb Constraints textlength patternlength text pattern consist only lowercase English letters
