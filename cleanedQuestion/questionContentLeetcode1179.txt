Detect Pattern Length Repeated More Times Given array positive integers arr find pattern length repeated more times pattern subarray consecutive subsequence consists one more values repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping pattern defined by its length number repetitions Return true if there exists pattern length repeated more times otherwise return false Example Input arr Output true Explanation pattern length repeated consecutive times Notice pattern can be repeated more times but not less Example Input arr Output true Explanation pattern length repeated consecutive times Another valid pattern also repeated times Example Input arr Output false Explanation pattern length but repeated only times There no pattern length repeated more times Constraints arrlength arr
