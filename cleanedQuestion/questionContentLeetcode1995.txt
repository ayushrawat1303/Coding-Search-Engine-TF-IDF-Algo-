Minimum Number Operations Make All Array Elements Equal You given indexed array nums consisiting positive integers You can do following operation on array any number times Select index such replace either nums nums with their gcd value Return minimum number operations make all elements nums equal If it impossible return gcd two integers greatest common divisor two integers Example Input nums Output Explanation We can do following operations Choose index replace nums with gcd Now we have nums Choose index replace nums with gcd Now we have nums Choose index replace nums with gcd Now we have nums Choose index replace nums with gcd Now we have nums Example Input nums Output Explanation It can be shown it impossible make all elements equal Constraints numslength nums Followup On time complexity solution works but could you find constant time complexity solution
