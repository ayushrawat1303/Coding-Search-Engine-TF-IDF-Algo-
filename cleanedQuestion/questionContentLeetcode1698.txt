Check Distances Between Same Letters You given indexed string consisting only lowercase English letters where each letter appears exactly twice You also given indexed integer array distance length Each letter alphabet numbered from ie wellspaced string number letters between two occurrences ith letter distance If ith letter does not appear then distance can be ignored Return true if wellspaced string otherwise return false Example Input abaccb distance Output true Explanation appears indices so it satisfies distance appears indices so it satisfies distance appears indices so it satisfies distance Note distance but since does not appear it can be ignored Return true because wellspaced string Example Input aa distance Output false Explanation appears indices so there zero letters between them Because distance not wellspaced string Constraints slength consists only lowercase English letters Each letter appears exactly twice distancelength distance
