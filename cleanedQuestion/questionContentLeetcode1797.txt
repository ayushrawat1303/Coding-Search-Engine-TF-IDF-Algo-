Minimum Total Distance Traveled There some robots factories on Xaxis You given integer array robot where robot position ith robot You also given integer array factory where factory indicates positionj position jth factory jth factory can repair most limitj robots positions each robot unique positions each factory also unique Note robot can be same position as factory initially All robots initially broken they keep moving one direction direction could be negative positive direction Xaxis When robot reaches factory did not reach its limit factory repairs robot it stops moving any moment you can set initial direction moving for some robot Your target minimize total distance traveled by all robots Return minimum total distance traveled by all robots test cases generated such all robots can be repaired Note All robots move same speed If two robots move same direction they will never collide If two robots move opposite directions they meet some point they do not collide They cross each other If robot passes by factory reached its limits it crosses it as if it does not exist If robot moved from position position distance it moved Example Input robot factory Output Explanation As shown figure first robot position moves positive direction It will be repaired first factory second robot position moves negative direction It will be repaired first factory third robot position will be repaired second factory It does not need move limit first factory it fixed robots limit second factory it fixed robot total distance It can be shown we cannot achieve better total distance than Example Input robot factory Output Explanation As shown figure first robot position moves positive direction It will be repaired second factory second robot position moves negative direction It will be repaired first factory limit first factory it fixed robot limit second factory it fixed robot total distance It can be shown we cannot achieve better total distance than Constraints robotlength factorylength factorylength robot positionj limitj robotlength input will be generated such it always possible repair every robot
