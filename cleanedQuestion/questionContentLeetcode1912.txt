Count Ways Group Overlapping Ranges You given integer array ranges where ranges denotes all integers between starti endi both inclusive contained ith range You split ranges into two possibly empty groups such Each range belongs exactly one group Any two overlapping ranges must belong same group Two ranges said be overlapping if there exists least one integer present both ranges For example overlapping because occur both ranges Return total number ways split ranges into two groups Since answer may be very large return it modulo Example Input ranges Output Explanation two ranges overlapping so they must be same group Thus there two possible ways Put both ranges together group Put both ranges together group Example Input ranges Output Explanation Ranges overlapping So they must be same group Again ranges also overlapping So they must also be same group Thus there four possible ways group them All ranges group All ranges group Ranges group group Ranges group group Constraints rangeslength rangeslength starti endi
