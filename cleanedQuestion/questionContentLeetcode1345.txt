Maximize Number Nice Divisors You given positive integer primeFactors You asked construct positive integer satisfies following conditions number prime factors not necessarily distinct most primeFactors number nice divisors maximized Note divisor nice if it divisible by every prime factor For example if then its prime factors then nice divisors while not Return number nice divisors Since number can be too large return it modulo Note prime number natural number greater than not product two smaller natural numbers prime factors number list prime numbers such their product equals Example Input primeFactors Output Explanation valid value It has prime factors it has nice divisors There not other value has most prime factors more nice divisors Example Input primeFactors Output Constraints primeFactors
