Two Sum II Input Array Sorted Given indexed array integers numbers already sorted nondecreasing order find two numbers such they add up specific target number Let these two numbers be numbers numbers where index index numberslength Return indices two numbers index index added by one as integer array length tests generated such there exactly one solution You may not use same element twice Your solution must use only constant extra space Example Input numbers target Output Explanation sum Therefore index index We return Example Input numbers target Output Explanation sum Therefore index index We return Example Input numbers target Output Explanation sum Therefore index index We return Constraints numberslength numbers numbers sorted nondecreasing order target tests generated such there exactly one solution
