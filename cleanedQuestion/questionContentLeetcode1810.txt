Frog Jump II You given indexed integer array stones sorted strictly increasing order representing positions stones river frog initially on first stone wants travel last stone then return first stone However it can jump any stone most once length jump absolute difference between position stone frog currently on position stone which frog jumps More formally if frog stones jumping stones length jump stones stones cost path maximum length jump among all jumps path Return minimum cost path for frog Example Input stones Output Explanation above figure represents one optimal paths frog can take cost this path which maximum length jump Since it not possible achieve cost less than we return it Example Input stones Output Explanation frog can jump directly last stone come back first stone this case length each jump will be cost for path will be max It can be shown this minimum achievable cost Constraints stoneslength stones stones stones sorted strictly increasing order
