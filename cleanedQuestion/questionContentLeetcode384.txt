Detonate Maximum Bombs You given list bombs range bomb defined as area where its effect can be felt This area shape circle with center as location bomb bombs represented by indexed integer array bombs where bombs xi yi denote Xcoordinate Ycoordinate location ith bomb whereas ri denotes radius its range You may choose detonate single bomb When bomb detonated it will detonate all bombs lie its range These bombs will further detonate bombs lie their ranges Given list bombs return maximum number bombs can be detonated if you allowed detonate only one bomb Example Input bombs Output Explanation above figure shows positions ranges bombs If we detonate left bomb right bomb will not be affected But if we detonate right bomb both bombs will be detonated So maximum bombs can be detonated max Example Input bombs Output Explanation Detonating either bomb will not detonate other bomb so maximum number bombs can be detonated Example Input bombs Output Explanation best bomb detonate bomb because Bomb detonates bombs red circle denotes range bomb Bomb detonates bomb blue circle denotes range bomb Bomb detonates bomb green circle denotes range bomb Thus all bombs detonated Constraints bombslength bombslength xi yi ri
