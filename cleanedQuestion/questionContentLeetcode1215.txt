Graph Connectivity With Threshold We have cities labeled from Two different cities with labels directly connected by bidirectional road if only if share common divisor strictly greater than some threshold More formally cities with labels have road between them if there exists integer such all following true threshold Given two integers threshold array queries you must determine for each queries if cities ai bi connected directly indirectly ie there some path between them Return array answer where answerlength querieslength answer true if for ith query there path between ai bi answer false if there no path Example Input threshold queries Output Explanation divisors for each number Using underlined divisors above threshold only cities share common divisor so they only ones directly connected result each query not connected not connected connected through path Example Input threshold queries Output Explanation divisors for each number same as previous example However since threshold all divisors can be used Since all numbers share as divisor all cities connected Example Input threshold queries Output Explanation Only cities share common divisor which strictly greater than threshold so they only ones directly connected Please notice there can be multiple queries for same pair nodes query equivalent query Constraints threshold querieslength querieslength ai bi cities ai bi
