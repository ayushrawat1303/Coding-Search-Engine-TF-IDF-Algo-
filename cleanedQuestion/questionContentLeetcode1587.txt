Maximum Trailing Zeros Cornered Path You given integer array grid size where each cell contains positive integer cornered path defined as set adjacent cells with most one turn More specifically path should exclusively move either horizontally vertically up turn if there one without returning previously visited cell After turn path will then move exclusively alternate direction move vertically if it moved horizontally vice versa also without returning previously visited cell product path defined as product all values path Return maximum number trailing zeros product cornered path found grid Note Horizontal movement means moving either left right direction Vertical movement means moving either up down direction Example Input grid Output Explanation grid on left shows valid cornered path It has product which has trailing zeros It can be shown this maximum trailing zeros product cornered path grid middle not cornered path as it has more than one turn grid on right not cornered path as it requires return previously visited cell Example Input grid Output Explanation grid shown figure above There no cornered paths grid result product with trailing zero Constraints gridlength gridlength grid
