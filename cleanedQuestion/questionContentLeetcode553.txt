Reachable Nodes Subdivided Graph You given undirected graph original graph with nodes labeled from You decide subdivide each edge graph into chain nodes with number new nodes varying between each edge graph given as array edges where edges indicates there edge between nodes ui vi original graph cnti total number new nodes you will subdivide edge into Note cnti means you will not subdivide edge subdivide edge replace it with cnti new edges cnti new nodes new nodes xcnti new edges this new graph you want know how many nodes reachable from node where node reachable if distance maxMoves less Given original graph maxMoves return number nodes reachable from node new graph Example Input edges maxMoves Output Explanation edge subdivisions shown image above nodes reachable highlighted yellow Example Input edges maxMoves Output Example Input edges maxMoves Output Explanation Node disconnected from rest graph so only node reachable Constraints edgeslength minn edgeslength ui vi There no multiple edges graph cnti maxMoves
