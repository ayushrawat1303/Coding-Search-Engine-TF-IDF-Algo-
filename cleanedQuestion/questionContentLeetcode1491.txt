Score Students Solving Math Expression You given string contains digits addition symbols multiplication symbols only representing valid math expression single digit numbers eg This expression was given elementary school students students were instructed get answer expression by following this order operations Compute multiplication reading from left right Then Compute addition reading from left right You given integer array answers length which submitted answers students no particular order You asked grade answers by following these rules If answer equals correct answer expression this student will be rewarded points Otherwise if answer could be interpreted as if student applied operators wrong order but had correct arithmetic this student will be rewarded points Otherwise this student will be rewarded points Return sum points students Example Input answers Output Explanation As illustrated above correct answer expression therefore one student rewarded points student might have applied operators this wrong order Therefore one student rewarded points points for students sum points Example Input answers Output Explanation correct answer expression therefore three students rewarded points each student might have applied operators this wrong order Therefore two students rewarded points points for students sum points Example Input answers Output Explanation correct answer expression If student had incorrectly done answer would also be By rules grading students will still be rewarded points as they got correct answer not points points for students sum points Constraints slength represents valid expression contains only digits only All integer operands expression inclusive range count all operators math expression Test data generated such correct answer expression range answerslength answers
