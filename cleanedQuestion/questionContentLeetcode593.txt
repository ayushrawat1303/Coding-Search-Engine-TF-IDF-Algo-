Minimum Number Refueling Stops car travels from starting position destination which target miles east starting position There gas stations along way gas stations represented as array stations where stations indicates ith gas station positioni miles east starting position has fueli liters gas car starts with infinite tank gas which initially has startFuel liters fuel it It uses one liter gas per one mile it drives When car reaches gas station it may stop refuel transferring all gas from station into car Return minimum number refueling stops car must make order reach its destination If it cannot reach destination return Note if car reaches gas station with fuel left car can still refuel there If car reaches destination with fuel left it still considered have arrived Example Input target startFuel stations Output Explanation We can reach target without refueling Example Input target startFuel stations Output Explanation We can not reach target even first gas station Example Input target startFuel stations Output Explanation We start with liters fuel We drive position expending liters fuel We refuel from liters liters gas Then we drive from position position expending liters fuel refuel from liters liters gas We then drive reach target We made refueling stops along way so we return Constraints target startFuel stationslength positioni positioni target fueli
