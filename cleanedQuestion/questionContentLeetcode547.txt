Smallest Subtree with all Deepest Nodes Given root binary tree depth each node shortest distance root Return smallest subtree such it contains all deepest nodes original tree node called deepest if it has largest depth possible among any node entire tree subtree node tree consisting node plus set all descendants node Example Input root Output Explanation We return node with value colored yellow diagram nodes coloured blue deepest nodes tree Notice nodes contain deepest nodes tree but node smallest subtree among them so we return it Example Input root Output Explanation root deepest node tree Example Input root Output Explanation deepest node tree valid subtrees subtrees nodes but subtree node smallest Constraints number nodes tree will be range Nodeval values nodes tree unique Note This question same as httpsleetcodecomproblemslowestcommonancestorofdeepestleaves
