Number Distinct Roll Sequences You given integer You roll fair sided dice times Determine total number distinct sequences rolls possible such following conditions satisfied greatest common divisor any adjacent values sequence equal There least gap rolls between equal valued rolls More formally if value ith roll equal value jth roll then absi Return total number distinct sequences possible Since answer may be very large return it modulo Two sequences considered distinct if least one element different Example Input Output Explanation Some possible sequences etc Some invalid sequences invalid since first third roll have equal value abs indexed invalid since greatest common divisor There total distinct sequences possible so we return Example Input Output Explanation Some possible sequences Some invalid sequences since greatest common divisor not equal There total distinct sequences possible so we return Constraints
