Graph Bipartite There undirected graph with nodes where each node numbered between You given array graph where graph array nodes node adjacent More formally for each graph there undirected edge between node node graph has following properties There no selfedges graph does not contain There no parallel edges graph does not contain duplicate values If graph then graph graph undirected graph may not be connected meaning there may be two nodes such there no path between them graph bipartite if nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets such every edge graph connects node set node set Return true if only if it bipartite Example Input graph Output false Explanation There no way partition nodes into two independent sets such every edge connects node one node other Example Input graph Output true Explanation We can partition nodes into two sets Constraints graphlength graphlength graph graph does not contain All values graph unique If graph contains then graph contains
