Build Array With Stack Operations You given integer array target integer You have empty stack with two following operations Push pushes integer top stack Pop removes integer on top stack You also have stream integers range Use two stack operations make numbers stack from bottom top equal target You should follow following rules If stream integers not empty pick next integer from stream push it top stack If stack not empty pop integer top stack If any moment elements stack from bottom top equal target do not read new integers from stream do not do more operations on stack Return stack operations needed build target following mentioned rules If there multiple valid answers return any them Example Input target Output Explanation Initially stack empty last element top stack Read from stream push it stack Read from stream push it stack Pop integer on top stack Read from stream push it stack Example Input target Output Explanation Initially stack empty last element top stack Read from stream push it stack Read from stream push it stack Read from stream push it stack Example Input target Output Explanation Initially stack empty last element top stack Read from stream push it stack Read from stream push it stack Since stack from bottom top equal target we stop stack operations answers read integer from stream not accepted Constraints targetlength target target strictly increasing
