Count Hills Valleys Array You given indexed integer array nums index part hill nums if closest nonequal neighbors smaller than nums Similarly index part valley nums if closest nonequal neighbors larger than nums Adjacent indices part same hill valley if nums nums Note for index be part hill valley it must have nonequal neighbor on both left right index Return number hills valleys nums Example Input nums Output Explanation index There no nonequal neighbor on left so index neither hill nor valley index closest nonequal neighbors Since index hill index closest nonequal neighbors Since index valley index closest nonequal neighbors Since index valley but note it part same valley as index index closest nonequal neighbors Since index hill index There no nonequal neighbor on right so index neither hill nor valley There hills valleys so we return Example Input nums Output Explanation index There no nonequal neighbor on left so index neither hill nor valley index There no nonequal neighbor on left so index neither hill nor valley index closest nonequal neighbors Since index neither hill nor valley index closest nonequal neighbors Since index neither hill nor valley index closest nonequal neighbors Since index neither hill nor valley index There no nonequal neighbor on right so index neither hill nor valley There hills valleys so we return Constraints numslength nums
