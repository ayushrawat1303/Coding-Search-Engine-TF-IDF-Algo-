Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number Groups You given integer array intervals where intervals represents inclusive interval You have divide intervals into one more groups such each interval exactly one group no two intervals same group intersect each other Return minimum number groups you need make Two intervals intersect if there least one common number between them For example intervals intersect Example Input intervals Output Explanation We can divide intervals into following groups Group Group Group It can be proven it not possible divide intervals into fewer than groups Example Input intervals Output Explanation None intervals overlap so we can put all them one group Constraints intervalslength intervalslength lefti righti
