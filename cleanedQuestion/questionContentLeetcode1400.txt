Describe Painting There long thin painting can be represented by number line painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with unique color You given integer array segments where segments represents halfclosed segment starti endi with colori as color colors overlapping segments painting were mixed when it was painted When two more colors mix they form new color can be represented as set mixed colors For example if colors mixed then resulting mixed color For sake simplicity you should only output sum elements set rather than full set You want describe painting with minimum number nonoverlapping halfclosed segments these mixed colors These segments can be represented by array painting where painting describes halfclosed segment leftj rightj with mixed color sum mixj For example painting created with segments can be described by painting because colored with sum from both first second segments colored from only second segment Return array painting describing finished painting excluding any parts not painted You may return segments any order halfclosed segment section number line between points including point not including point Example Input segments Output Explanation painting can be described as follows colored with sum from first third segments colored with sum from second third segments Example Input segments Output Explanation painting can be described as follows colored from first segment colored with sum from first second segments colored from second segment colored from third segment Example Input segments Output Explanation painting can be described as follows colored with sum from first second segments colored with sum from third fourth segments Note returning single segment incorrect because mixed color sets different Constraints segmentslength segmentslength starti endi colori Each colori distinct
