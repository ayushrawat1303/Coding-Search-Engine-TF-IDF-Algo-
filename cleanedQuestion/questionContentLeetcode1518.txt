Maximum Twin Sum Linked List linked list size where even ith node indexed linked list known as twin nith node if For example if then node twin node node twin node These only nodes with twins for twin sum defined as sum node its twin Given head linked list with even length return maximum twin sum linked list Example Input head Output Explanation Nodes twins nodes respectively All have twin sum There no other nodes with twins linked list Thus maximum twin sum linked list Example Input head Output Explanation nodes with twins present this linked list Node twin node having twin sum Node twin node having twin sum Thus maximum twin sum linked list max Example Input head Output Explanation There only one node with twin linked list having twin sum Constraints number nodes list even integer range Nodeval
