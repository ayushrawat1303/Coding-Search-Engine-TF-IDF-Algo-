Count Collisions Monkeys on Polygon There regular convex polygon with vertices vertices labeled from clockwise direction each vertex has exactly one monkey following figure shows convex polygon vertices Each monkey moves simultaneously neighboring vertex neighboring vertex for vertex can be vertex clockwise direction vertex counterclockwise direction collision happens if least two monkeys reside on same vertex after movement intersect on edge Return number ways monkeys can move so least one collision happens Since answer may be very large return it modulo Note each monkey can only move once Example Input Output Explanation There total possible movements Two ways such they collide some point Monkey moves clockwise direction monkey moves anticlockwise direction monkey moves clockwise direction Monkeys collide Monkey moves anticlockwise direction monkey moves anticlockwise direction monkey moves clockwise direction Monkeys collide It can be shown total movements result collision Example Input Output Explanation It can be shown there ways for monkeys collide Constraints
