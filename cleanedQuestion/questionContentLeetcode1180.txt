Min Cost Connect All Points You given array points representing integer coordinates some points on Dplane where points cost connecting two points manhattan distance between them xi xj yi yj where val denotes absolute value val Return minimum cost make all points connected All points connected if there exactly one simple path between any two points Example Input points Output Explanation We can connect points as shown above get minimum cost Notice there unique path between every pair points Example Input points Output Constraints pointslength xi yi All pairs xi yi distinct
