Count Different Palindromic Subsequences Given string return number different nonempty palindromic subsequences Since answer may be very large return it modulo subsequence string obtained by deleting zero more characters from string sequence palindromic if it equal sequence reversed Two sequences different if there some for which ai bi Example Input bccb Output Explanation different nonempty palindromic subsequences bb cc bcb bccb Note bcb counted only once even though it occurs twice Example Input abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba Output Explanation There different nonempty palindromic subsequences which modulo Constraints slength either
