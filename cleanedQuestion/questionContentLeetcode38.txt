Next Permutation permutation array integers arrangement its members into sequence linear order For example for arr following all permutations arr next permutation array integers next lexicographically greater permutation its integer More formally if all permutations array sorted one container according their lexicographical order then next permutation array permutation follows it sorted container If such arrangement not possible array must be rearranged as lowest possible order ie sorted ascending order For example next permutation arr Similarly next permutation arr While next permutation arr because does not have lexicographical larger rearrangement Given array integers nums find next permutation nums replacement must be place use only constant extra memory Example Input nums Output Example Input nums Output Example Input nums Output Constraints numslength nums
