Find Eventual Safe States There directed graph nodes with each node labeled from graph represented by indexed integer array graph where graph integer array nodes adjacent node meaning there edge from node each node graph node terminal node if there no outgoing edges node safe node if every possible path starting from node leads terminal node another safe node Return array containing all safe nodes graph answer should be sorted ascending order Example Input graph Output Explanation given graph shown above Nodes terminal nodes as there no outgoing edges from either them Every path starting nodes all lead either node Example Input graph Output Explanation Only node terminal node every path starting node leads node Constraints graphlength graphlength graph graph sorted strictly increasing order graph may contain selfloops number edges graph will be range
