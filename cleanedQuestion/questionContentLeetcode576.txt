Maximum Frequency Stack Design stacklike data structure push elements stack pop most frequent element from stack Implement FreqStack class FreqStack constructs empty frequency stack void pushint val pushes integer val onto top stack int pop removes returns most frequent element stack If there tie for most frequent element element closest stacks top removed returned Example Input Output Explanation FreqStack freqStack new FreqStack freqStackpush stack freqStackpush stack freqStackpush stack freqStackpush stack freqStackpush stack freqStackpush stack freqStackpop return as most frequent stack becomes freqStackpop return as most frequent but closest top stack becomes freqStackpop return as most frequent stack becomes freqStackpop return as most frequent but closest top stack becomes Constraints val most calls will be made push pop It guaranteed there will be least one element stack before calling pop
