Swim Rising Water You given integer matrix grid where each value grid represents elevation point rain starts fall time depth water everywhere You can swim from square another directionally adjacent square if only if elevation both squares individually most You can swim infinite distances zero time course you must stay within boundaries grid during your swim Return least time until you can reach bottom right square if you start top left square Example Input grid Output Explanation time you grid location You cannot go anywhere else because directionally adjacent neighbors have higher elevation than You cannot reach point until time When depth water we can swim anywhere inside grid Example Input grid Output Explanation final route shown We need wait until time so connected Constraints gridlength gridlength grid Each value grid unique
