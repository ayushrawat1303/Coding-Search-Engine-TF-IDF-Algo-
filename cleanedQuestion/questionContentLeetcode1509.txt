Second Minimum Time Reach Destination city represented as bidirectional connected graph with vertices where each vertex labeled from inclusive edges graph represented as integer array edges where each edges denotes bidirectional edge between vertex ui vertex vi Every vertex pair connected by most one edge no vertex has edge itself time taken traverse any edge time minutes Each vertex has traffic signal which changes its color from green red vice versa every change minutes All signals change same time You can enter vertex any time but can leave vertex only when signal green You cannot wait vertex if signal green second minimum value defined as smallest value strictly larger than minimum value For example second minimum value second minimum value Given edges time change return second minimum time it will take go from vertex vertex Notes You can go through any vertex any number times including You can assume when journey starts all signals have just turned green Example Input edges time change Output Explanation figure on left shows given graph blue path figure on right minimum time path time taken Start time elapsed minutes time elapsed minutes time elapsed Hence minimum time needed minutes red path shows path get second minimum time Start time elapsed minutes time elapsed minutes time elapsed Wait for minutes time elapsed minutes time elapsed Hence second minimum time minutes Example Input edges time change Output Explanation minimum time path with time minutes second minimum time path with time minutes Constraints edgeslength min edgeslength ui vi ui vi There no duplicate edges Each vertex can be reached directly indirectly from every other vertex time change
