Shortest Path with Alternating Colors You given integer number nodes directed graph where nodes labeled from Each edge red blue this graph there could be selfedges parallel edges You given two arrays redEdges blueEdges where redEdges indicates there directed red edge from node ai node bi graph blueEdges indicates there directed blue edge from node uj node vj graph Return array answer length where each answer length shortest path from node node such edge colors alternate along path if such path does not exist Example Input redEdges blueEdges Output Example Input redEdges blueEdges Output Constraints redEdgeslength blueEdgeslength redEdgeslength blueEdgeslength ai bi uj vj
