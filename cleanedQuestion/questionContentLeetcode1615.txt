Replace Elements Array You given indexed array nums consists distinct positive integers Apply operations this array where ith operation you replace number operations with operations It guaranteed ith operation operations exists nums operations does not exist nums Return array obtained after applying all operations Example Input nums operations Output Explanation We perform following operations on nums Replace number with nums becomes Replace number with nums becomes Replace number with nums becomes We return final array Example Input nums operations Output Explanation We perform following operations nums Replace number with nums becomes Replace number with nums becomes Replace number with nums becomes We return array Constraints numslength operationslength All values nums distinct operationslength nums operations operations operations will exist nums when applying ith operation operations will not exist nums when applying ith operation
