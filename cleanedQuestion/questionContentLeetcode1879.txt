Maximize Minimum Powered City You given indexed integer array stations length where stations represents number power stations ith city Each power station can provide power every city fixed range other words if range denoted by then power station city can provide power all cities such Note denotes absolute value For example power city total number power stations it being provided power from government has sanctioned building more power stations each which can be built any city have same range as preexisting ones Given two integers return maximum possible minimum power city if additional power stations built optimally Note you can build power stations multiple cities Example Input stations Output Explanation One optimal ways install both power stations city So stations will become City provided by power stations City provided by power stations City provided by power stations City provided by power stations City provided by power stations So minimum power city Since it not possible obtain larger power we return Example Input stations Output Explanation It can be proved we cannot make minimum power city greater than Constraints stationslength stations
