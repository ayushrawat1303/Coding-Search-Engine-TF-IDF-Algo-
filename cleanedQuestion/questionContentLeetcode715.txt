Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal Given array integers preorder which represents preorder traversal BST ie binary search tree construct tree return its root It guaranteed there always possible find binary search tree with given requirements for given test cases binary search tree binary tree where for every node any descendant Nodeleft has value strictly less than Nodeval any descendant Noderight has value strictly greater than Nodeval preorder traversal binary tree displays value node first then traverses Nodeleft then traverses Noderight Example Input preorder Output Example Input preorder Output Constraints preorderlength preorder All values preorder unique
