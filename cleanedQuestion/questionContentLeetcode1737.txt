Longest Cycle Graph You given directed graph nodes numbered from where each node has most one outgoing edge graph represented with given indexed array edges size indicating there directed edge from node node edges If there no outgoing edge from node then edges Return length longest cycle graph If no cycle exists return cycle path starts ends same node Example Input edges Output Explanation longest cycle graph cycle length this cycle so returned Example Input edges Output Explanation There no cycles this graph Constraints edgeslength edges edges
