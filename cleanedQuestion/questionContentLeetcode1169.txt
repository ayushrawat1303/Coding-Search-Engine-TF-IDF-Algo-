Make Sum Divisible by Given array positive integers nums remove smallest subarray possibly empty such sum remaining elements divisible by It not allowed remove whole array Return length smallest subarray you need remove if its impossible subarray defined as contiguous block elements array Example Input nums Output Explanation sum elements nums which not divisible by We can remove subarray sum remaining elements which divisible by Example Input nums Output Explanation We cannot remove single element get sum divisible by best way remove subarray leaving us with with sum Example Input nums Output Explanation Here sum which already divisible by Thus we do not need remove anything Constraints numslength nums
