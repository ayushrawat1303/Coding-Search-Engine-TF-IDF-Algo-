Merge Two Arrays by Summing Values You given two integer arrays nums nums nums indicate number with id idi has value equal vali nums indicate number with id idi has value equal vali Each array contains unique ids sorted ascending order by id Merge two arrays into one array sorted ascending order by id respecting following conditions Only ids appear least one two arrays should be included resulting array Each id should be included only once its value should be sum values this id two arrays If id does not exist one two arrays then its value array considered be Return resulting array returned array must be sorted ascending order by id Example Input nums nums Output Explanation resulting array contains following id value this id id value this id id value this id id value this id Example Input nums nums Output Explanation There no common ids so we just include each id with its value resulting list Constraints numslength numslength numslength numslength idi vali Both arrays contain unique ids Both arrays strictly ascending order by id
