Vertical Order Traversal Binary Tree Given root binary tree calculate vertical order traversal binary tree For each node position row col its left right children will be positions row col row col respectively root tree vertical order traversal binary tree list toptobottom orderings for each column index starting from leftmost column ending on rightmost column There may be multiple nodes same row same column such case sort these nodes by their values Return vertical order traversal binary tree Example Input root Output Explanation Column Only node this column Column Nodes this column order from top bottom Column Only node this column Column Only node this column Example Input root Output Explanation Column Only node this column Column Only node this column Column Nodes this column top so it comes first same position so we order them by their value before Column Only node this column Column Only node this column Example Input root Output Explanation This case exact same as example but with nodes swapped Note solution remains same since same location should be ordered by their values Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval
