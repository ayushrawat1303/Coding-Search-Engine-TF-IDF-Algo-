Flatten Multilevel Doubly Linked List You given doubly linked list which contains nodes have next pointer previous pointer additional child pointer This child pointer may may not point separate doubly linked list also containing these special nodes These child lists may have one more children their own so on produce multilevel data structure as shown example below Given head first level list flatten list so all nodes appear singlelevel doubly linked list Let curr be node with child list nodes child list should appear after curr before currnext flattened list Return head flattened list nodes list must have all their child pointers set null Example Input head Output Explanation multilevel linked list input shown After flattening multilevel linked list it becomes Example Input head Output Explanation multilevel linked list input shown After flattening multilevel linked list it becomes Example Input head Output Explanation There could be empty list input Constraints number Nodes will not exceed Nodeval How multilevel linked list represented test cases We use multilevel linked list from Example above NULL NULL NULL serialization each level as follows serialize all levels together we will add nulls each level signify no node connects upper node previous level serialization becomes Merging serialization each level removing trailing nulls we obtain
