Create Components With Same Value There undirected tree with nodes labeled from You given indexed integer array nums length where nums represents value ith node You also given integer array edges length where edges indicates there edge between nodes ai bi tree You allowed delete some edges splitting tree into multiple connected components Let value component be sum all nums for which node component Return maximum number edges you can delete such every connected component tree has same value Example Input nums edges Output Explanation above figure shows how we can delete edges created components nodes sum values each component equals It can be proven no better deletion exists so answer Example Input nums edges Output Explanation There no edges be deleted Constraints numslength nums edgeslength edgeslength edges edges edges represents valid tree
