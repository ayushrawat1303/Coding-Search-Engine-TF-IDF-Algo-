Maximum Binary Tree II maximum tree tree where every node has value greater than any other value its subtree You given root maximum binary tree integer val Just as previous problem given tree was constructed from list root Constructa recursively with following Constructa routine If empty return null Otherwise let be largest element Create root node with value left child root will be Construct right child root will be Construct Return root Note we were not given directly only root node root Constructa Suppose copy with value val appended it It guaranteed has unique values Return Constructb Example Input root val Output Explanation Example Input root val Output Explanation Example Input root val Output Explanation Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval All values tree unique val
