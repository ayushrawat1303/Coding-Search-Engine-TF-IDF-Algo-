Maximum Subsequence Score You given two indexed integer arrays nums nums equal length positive integer You must choose subsequence indices from nums length For chosen indices ik your score defined as sum selected elements from nums multiplied with minimum selected elements from nums It can defined simply as nums nums nums minnums nums nums Return maximum possible score subsequence indices array set can be derived from set by deleting some no elements Example Input nums nums Output Explanation four possible subsequence scores We choose indices with score min We choose indices with score min We choose indices with score min We choose indices with score min Therefore we return max score which Example Input nums nums Output Explanation Choosing index optimal nums nums maximum possible score Constraints numslength numslength nums nums
