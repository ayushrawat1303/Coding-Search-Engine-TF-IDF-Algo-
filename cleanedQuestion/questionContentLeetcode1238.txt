Checking Existence Edge Length Limited Paths undirected graph nodes defined by edgeList where edgeList denotes edge between nodes ui vi with distance disi Note there may be multiple edges between two nodes Given array queries where queries your task determine for each queries whether there path between pj qj such each edge on path has distance strictly less than limitj Return boolean array answer where answerlength querieslength jth value answer true if there path for queries true false otherwise Example Input edgeList queries Output Explanation above figure shows given graph Note there two overlapping edges between with distances For first query between there no path where each distance less than thus we return false for this query For second query there path two edges with distances less than thus we return true for this query Example Input edgeList queries Output Explanation above figure shows given graph Constraints edgeListlength querieslength edgeListlength querieslength ui vi pj qj ui vi pj qj disi limitj There may be multiple edges between two nodes
