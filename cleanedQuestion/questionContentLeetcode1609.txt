Largest Combination With Bitwise Greater Than Zero bitwise array nums bitwise all integers nums For example for nums bitwise equal Also for nums bitwise You given array positive integers candidates Evaluate bitwise every combination numbers candidates Each number candidates may only be used once each combination Return size largest combination candidates with bitwise greater than Example Input candidates Output Explanation combination has bitwise size combination It can be shown no combination with size greater than has bitwise greater than Note more than one combination may have largest size For example combination has bitwise Example Input candidates Output Explanation largest combination has bitwise size combination so we return Constraints candidateslength candidates
