Count Number Complete Components You given integer There undirected graph with vertices numbered from You given integer array edges where edges denotes there exists undirected edge connecting vertices ai bi Return number complete connected components graph connected component subgraph graph which there exists path between any two vertices no vertex subgraph shares edge with vertex outside subgraph connected component said be complete if there exists edge between every pair its vertices Example Input edges Output Explanation From picture above one can see all components this graph complete Example Input edges Output Explanation component containing vertices complete since there edge between every pair two vertices On other hand component containing vertices not complete since there no edge between vertices Thus number complete components this graph Constraints edgeslength edgeslength ai bi ai bi There no repeated edges
