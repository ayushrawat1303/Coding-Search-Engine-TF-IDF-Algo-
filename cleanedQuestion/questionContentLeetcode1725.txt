Longest Ideal Subsequence You given string consisting lowercase letters integer We call string ideal if following conditions satisfied subsequence string absolute difference alphabet order every two adjacent letters less than equal Return length longest ideal string subsequence string can be derived from another string by deleting some no characters without changing order remaining characters Note alphabet order not cyclic For example absolute difference alphabet order not Example Input acfgbd Output Explanation longest ideal string acbd length this string so returned Note acfgbd not ideal because have difference alphabet order Example Input abcd Output Explanation longest ideal string abcd length this string so returned Constraints slength consists lowercase English letters
