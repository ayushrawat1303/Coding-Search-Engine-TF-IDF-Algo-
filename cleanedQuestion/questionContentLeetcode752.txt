Escape Large Maze There million by million grid on XYplane coordinates each grid square We start source square want reach target square There also array blocked squares where each blocked represents blocked square with coordinates xi yi Each move we can walk one square north east south west if square not array blocked squares We also not allowed walk outside grid Return true if only if it possible reach target square from source square through sequence valid moves Example Input blocked source target Output false Explanation target square inaccessible starting from source square because we cannot move We cannot move north east because those squares blocked We cannot move south west because we cannot go outside grid Example Input blocked source target Output true Explanation Because there no blocked cells it possible reach target square Constraints blockedlength blockedlength xi yi sourcelength targetlength sx sy tx ty source target It guaranteed source target not blocked
