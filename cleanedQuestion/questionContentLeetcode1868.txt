Closest Prime Numbers Range Given two positive integers left right find two integers num num such left nums nums right nums nums both prime numbers nums nums minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying above conditions Return positive integer array ans If there multiple pairs satisfying these conditions return one with minimum nums value if such numbers do not exist number greater than called prime if it only divisible by itself Example Input left right Output Explanation prime numbers between closest gap between any pair which can be achieved by Since smaller than we return first pair Example Input left right Output Explanation There exists only one prime number given range so conditions cannot be satisfied Constraints left right
