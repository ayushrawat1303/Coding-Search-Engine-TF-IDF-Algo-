Count Number Special Subsequences sequence special if it consists positive number followed by positive number then positive number For example special contrast not special Given array nums consisting only integers return number different subsequences special Since answer may be very large return it modulo subsequence array sequence can be derived from array by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements Two subsequences different if set indices chosen different Example Input nums Output Explanation special subsequences bolded Example Input nums Output Explanation There no special subsequences Example Input nums Output Explanation special subsequences bolded Constraints numslength nums
