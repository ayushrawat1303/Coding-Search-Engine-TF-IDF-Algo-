Memoize II Given function fn return memoized version function memoized function function will never be called twice with same inputs Instead it will return cached value fn can be any function there no constraints on what type values it accepts Inputs considered identical if they each other Example Input getInputs fn function return Output Explanation const inputs getInputs const memoized memoizefn for const arr inputs memoizedarr For inputs it required call fn For inputs but those inputs were seen before so no call fn was required For inputs it required another call fn for total Example Input getInputs fn function return Output Explanation Merging two empty objects will always result empty object It may seem like there should only be call fn because cachehits however none those objects each other Example Input getInputs const return fn function return Output Explanation Merging two empty objects will always result empty object nd rd third function calls result cachehit This because every object passed identical Constraints inputslength inputsflatlength inputs NaN
