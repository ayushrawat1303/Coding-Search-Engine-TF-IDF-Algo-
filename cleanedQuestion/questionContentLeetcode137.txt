Delete Node Linked List There singlylinked list head we want delete node node it You given node be deleted node You will not be given access first node head All values linked list unique it guaranteed given node node not last node linked list Delete given node Note by deleting node we do not mean removing it from memory We mean value given node should not exist linked list number nodes linked list should decrease by one All values before node should be same order All values after node should be same order Custom testing For input you should provide entire linked list head node be given node node should not be last node list should be actual node list We will build linked list pass node your function output will be entire list after calling your function Example Input head node Output Explanation You given second node with value linked list should become after calling your function Example Input head node Output Explanation You given third node with value linked list should become after calling your function Constraints number nodes given list range Nodeval value each node list unique node be deleted list not tail node
