Minimize Maximum Two Arrays We have two arrays arr arr which initially empty You need add positive integers them such they satisfy all following conditions arr contains uniqueCnt distinct positive integers each which not divisible by divisor arr contains uniqueCnt distinct positive integers each which not divisible by divisor No integer present both arr arr Given divisor divisor uniqueCnt uniqueCnt return minimum possible maximum integer can be present either array Example Input divisor divisor uniqueCnt uniqueCnt Output Explanation We can distribute first natural numbers into arr arr arr arr We can see both arrays satisfy all conditions Since maximum value we return it Example Input divisor divisor uniqueCnt uniqueCnt Output Explanation Here arr arr satisfy all conditions Since maximum value we return it Example Input divisor divisor uniqueCnt uniqueCnt Output Explanation Here final possible arrays can be arr arr It can be shown it not possible obtain lower maximum satisfying all conditions Constraints divisor divisor uniqueCnt uniqueCnt uniqueCnt uniqueCnt
