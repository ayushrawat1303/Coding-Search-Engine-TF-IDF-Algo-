Longest Subsequence Repeated Times You given string length integer You tasked find longest subsequence repeated times string subsequence string can be derived from another string by deleting some no characters without changing order remaining characters subsequence seq repeated times string if seq subsequence where seq represents string constructed by concatenating seq times For example bba repeated times string bababcba because string bbabba constructed by concatenating bba times subsequence string bababcba Return longest subsequence repeated times string If multiple such subsequences found return lexicographically largest one If there no such subsequence return empty string Example Input letsleetcode Output let Explanation There two longest subsequences repeated times let ete let lexicographically largest one Example Input bb Output Explanation longest subsequence repeated times Example Input ab Output Explanation There no subsequence repeated times Empty string returned Constraints slength consists lowercase English letters
