Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters You given tree ie connected undirected graph has no cycles rooted node consisting nodes numbered from tree represented by indexed array parent size where parent parent node Since node root parent You also given string length where character assigned node Return length longest path tree such no pair adjacent nodes on path have same character assigned them Example Input parent abacbe Output Explanation longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters tree path length this path so returned It can be proven there no longer path satisfies conditions Example Input parent aabc Output Explanation longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters path length this path so returned Constraints parentlength slength parent for all parent parent represents valid tree consists only lowercase English letters
