Probability Two Boxes Having Same Number Distinct Balls Given balls distinct colors You will be given integer array balls size where balls number balls color All balls will be shuffled uniformly random then we will distribute first balls first box remaining balls other box Please read explanation second example carefully Please note two boxes considered different For example if we have two balls colors two boxes then distribution considered different than distribution Please read explanation first example carefully Return probability two boxes have same number distinct balls Answers within actual value will be accepted as correct Example Input balls Output Explanation Only ways divide balls equally ball color box ball color box ball color box ball color box both ways number distinct colors each box equal probability Example Input balls Output Explanation We have set balls This set balls will be shuffled randomly we may have one distinct shuffles with equal probability ie After we add first two balls first box second two balls second box We can see these possible random distributions have same number distinct colors balls each box Probability Example Input balls Output Explanation set balls It hard display all possible random shuffles this set but it easy check them will have same number distinct colors each box Probability Constraints ballslength balls sumballs even
