Number Unique Good Subsequences You given binary string binary subsequence binary considered good if it not empty has no leading zeros with exception Find number unique good subsequences binary For example if binary then all good subsequences so unique good subsequences Note subsequences not good because they have leading zeros Return number unique good subsequences binary Since answer may be very large return it modulo subsequence sequence can be derived from another sequence by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements Example Input binary Output Explanation good subsequences binary unique good subsequences Example Input binary Output Explanation good subsequences binary unique good subsequences Example Input binary Output Explanation good subsequences binary unique good subsequences Constraints binarylength binary consists only
