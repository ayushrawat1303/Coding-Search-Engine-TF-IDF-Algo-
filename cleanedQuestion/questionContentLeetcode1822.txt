Next Greater Element IV You given indexed array nonnegative integers nums For each integer nums you must find its respective second greater integer second greater integer nums nums such nums nums There exists exactly one index such nums nums If there no such nums second greater integer considered be For example array second greater integer Return integer array answer where answer second greater integer nums Example Input nums Output Explanation th index first integer greater than second integer greater than right st index first second integer greater than right nd index first second integer greater than right rd index There no integer greater than its right so second greater integer considered be th index There no integer greater than its right so second greater integer considered be Thus we return Example Input nums Output Explanation We return since neither integer has any integer greater than it Constraints numslength nums
