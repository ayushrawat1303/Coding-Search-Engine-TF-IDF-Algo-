Count Say countandsay sequence sequence digit strings defined by recursive formula countAndSay countAndSayn way you would say digit string from countAndSayn which then converted into different digit string determine how you say digit string split it into minimal number substrings such each substring contains exactly one unique digit Then for each substring say number digits then say digit Finally concatenate every said digit For example saying conversion for digit string Given positive integer return nth term countandsay sequence Example Input Output Explanation This base case Example Input Output Explanation countAndSay countAndSay say one countAndSay say two countAndSay say one one Constraints
