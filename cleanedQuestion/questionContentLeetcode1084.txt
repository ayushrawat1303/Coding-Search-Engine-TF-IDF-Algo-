PseudoPalindromic Paths Binary Tree Given binary tree where node values digits from path binary tree said be pseudopalindromic if least one permutation node values path palindrome Return number pseudopalindromic paths going from root node leaf nodes Example Input root Output Explanation figure above represents given binary tree There three paths going from root node leaf nodes red path green path path Among these paths only red path green path pseudopalindromic paths since red path can be rearranged palindrome green path can be rearranged palindrome Example Input root Output Explanation figure above represents given binary tree There three paths going from root node leaf nodes green path path path Among these paths only green path pseudopalindromic since can be rearranged palindrome Example Input root Output Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval
