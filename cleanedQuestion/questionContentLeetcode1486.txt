Time When Network Becomes Idle There network servers labeled from You given integer array edges where edges indicates there message channel between servers ui vi they can pass any number messages each other directly one second You also given indexed integer array patience length All servers connected ie message can be passed from one server any other servers directly indirectly through message channels server labeled master server rest data servers Each data server needs send its message master server for processing wait for reply Messages move between servers optimally so every message takes least amount time arrive master server master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly send reply originating server via reversed path message had gone through beginning second each data server sends its message be processed Starting from second beginning every second each data server will check if it has received reply message it sent including any newly arrived replies from master server If it has not it will resend message periodically data server will resend message every patience seconds ie data server will resend message if patience seconds have elapsed since last time message was sent from this server Otherwise no more resending will occur from this server network becomes idle when there no messages passing between servers arriving servers Return earliest second starting from which network becomes idle Example Input edges patience Output Explanation beginning second Data server sends its message denoted master server Data server sends its message denoted master server second Message arrives master server Master server processes message instantly sends reply back Server has not received any reply second patience elapsed since this server has sent message therefore it does not resend message Server has not received any reply second patience elapsed since this server has sent message therefore it resends message denoted second reply arrives server No more resending will occur from server Message arrives master server Master server processes message instantly sends reply back Server resends message denoted second reply arrives server No more resending will occur from server second reply arrives server Starting from beginning second there no messages passing between servers arriving servers This time when network becomes idle Example Input edges patience Output Explanation Data servers receive reply back beginning second From beginning second network becomes idle Constraints patiencelength patience patience for edgeslength min edgeslength ui vi ui vi There no duplicate edges Each server can directly indirectly reach another server
