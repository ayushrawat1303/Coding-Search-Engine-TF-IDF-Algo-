Restore Array From Adjacent Pairs There integer array nums consists unique elements but you have forgotten it However you do remember every pair adjacent elements nums You given integer array adjacentPairs size where each adjacentPairs indicates elements ui vi adjacent nums It guaranteed every adjacent pair elements nums nums will exist adjacentPairs either as nums nums pairs can appear any order Return original array nums If there multiple solutions return any them Example Input adjacentPairs Output Explanation This array has all its adjacent pairs adjacentPairs Notice adjacentPairs may not be lefttoright order Example Input adjacentPairs Output Explanation There can be negative numbers Another solution which would also be accepted Example Input adjacentPairs Output Constraints numslength adjacentPairslength adjacentPairslength nums ui vi There exists some nums has adjacentPairs as its pairs
