Partition Array Such Maximum Difference You given integer array nums integer You may partition nums into one more subsequences such each element nums appears exactly one subsequences Return minimum number subsequences needed such difference between maximum minimum values each subsequence most subsequence sequence can be derived from another sequence by deleting some no elements without changing order remaining elements Example Input nums Output Explanation We can partition nums into two subsequences difference between maximum minimum value first subsequence difference between maximum minimum value second subsequence Since two subsequences were created we return It can be shown minimum number subsequences needed Example Input nums Output Explanation We can partition nums into two subsequences difference between maximum minimum value first subsequence difference between maximum minimum value second subsequence Since two subsequences were created we return Note another optimal solution partition nums into two subsequences Example Input nums Output Explanation We can partition nums into three subsequences difference between maximum minimum value first subsequences difference between maximum minimum value second subsequences difference between maximum minimum value third subsequences Since three subsequences were created we return It can be shown minimum number subsequences needed Constraints numslength nums
