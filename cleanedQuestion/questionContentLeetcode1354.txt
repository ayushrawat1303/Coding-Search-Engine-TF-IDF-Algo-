Maximum Element After Decreasing Rearranging You given array positive integers arr Perform some operations possibly none on arr so it satisfies these conditions value first element arr must be absolute difference between any adjacent elements must be less than equal other words absarr arr for each where arrlength indexed absx absolute value There types operations you can perform any number times Decrease value any element arr smaller positive integer Rearrange elements arr be any order Return maximum possible value element arr after performing operations satisfy conditions Example Input arr Output Explanation We can satisfy conditions by rearranging arr so it becomes largest element arr Example Input arr Output Explanation One possible way satisfy conditions by doing following Rearrange arr so it becomes Decrease value second element Decrease value third element Now arr which satisfies conditions largest element arr Example Input arr Output Explanation array already satisfies conditions largest element Constraints arrlength arr
