Find Missing Observations You have observations sided dice rolls with each face numbered from observations went missing you only have observations rolls Fortunately you have also calculated average value rolls You given integer array rolls length where rolls value ith observation You also given two integers mean Return array length containing missing observations such average value rolls exactly mean If there multiple valid answers return any them If no such array exists return empty array average value set numbers sum numbers divided by Note mean integer so sum rolls should be divisible by Example Input rolls mean Output Explanation mean all rolls Example Input rolls mean Output Explanation mean all rolls Example Input rolls mean Output Explanation It impossible for mean be no matter what missing rolls Constraints rollslength rolls mean
