Find Most Competitive Subsequence Given integer array nums positive integer return most competitive subsequence nums size arrays subsequence resulting sequence obtained by erasing some possibly zero elements from array We define subsequence more competitive than subsequence same length if first position where differ subsequence has number less than corresponding number For example more competitive than because first position they differ final number less than Example Input nums Output Explanation Among set every possible subsequence most competitive Example Input nums Output Constraints numslength nums numslength
