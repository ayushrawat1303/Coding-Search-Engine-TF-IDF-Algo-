Divide Two Integers Given two integers dividend divisor divide two integers without using multiplication division mod operator integer division should truncate toward zero which means losing its fractional part For example would be truncated would be truncated Return quotient after dividing dividend by divisor Note Assume we dealing with environment could only store integers within bit signed integer range For this problem if quotient strictly greater than then return if quotient strictly less than then return Example Input dividend divisor Output Explanation which truncated Example Input dividend divisor Output Explanation which truncated Constraints dividend divisor divisor
