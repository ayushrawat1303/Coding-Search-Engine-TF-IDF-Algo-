Convert BST Greater Tree Given root Binary Search Tree BST convert it Greater Tree such every key original BST changed original key plus sum all keys greater than original key BST As reminder binary search tree tree satisfies these constraints left subtree node contains only nodes with keys less than nodes key right subtree node contains only nodes with keys greater than nodes key Both left right subtrees must also be binary search trees Example Input root Output Example Input root Output Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval All values tree unique root guaranteed be valid binary search tree Note This question same as httpsleetcodecomproblemsbinarysearchtreetogreatersumtree
