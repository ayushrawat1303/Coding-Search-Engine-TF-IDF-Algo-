Find Servers Handled Most Number Requests You have servers numbered from being used handle multiple requests simultaneously Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request time requests assigned servers according specific algorithm ith indexed request arrives If all servers busy request dropped not handled all If kth server available assign request server Otherwise assign request next available server wrapping around list servers starting from if necessary For example if ith server busy try assign request ith server then ith server so on You given strictly increasing array arrival positive integers where arrival represents arrival time ith request another array load where load represents load ith request time it takes complete Your goal find busiest servers server considered busiest if it handled most number requests successfully among all servers Return list containing IDs indexed busiest servers You may return IDs any order Example Input arrival load Output Explanation All servers start out available first requests handled by first servers order Request comes Server busy so its assigned next available server which Request comes It cannot be handled since all servers busy so it dropped Servers handled one request each while server handled two requests Hence server busiest server Example Input arrival load Output Explanation first requests handled by first servers Request comes It handled by server since server available Server handled two requests while servers handled one request each Hence server busiest server Example Input arrival load Output Explanation Each server handles single request so they all considered busiest Constraints arrivallength loadlength arrivallength loadlength arrival load arrival strictly increasing
