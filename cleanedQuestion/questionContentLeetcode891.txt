Get Equal Substrings Within Budget You given two strings same length integer maxCost You want change Changing ith character ith character costs ie absolute difference between ASCII values characters Return maximum length substring can be changed be same as corresponding substring with cost less than equal maxCost If there no substring from can be changed its corresponding substring from return Example Input abcd bcdf maxCost Output Explanation abc can change bcd costs so maximum length Example Input abcd cdef maxCost Output Explanation Each character costs change character so maximum length Example Input abcd acde maxCost Output Explanation You cannot make any change so maximum length Constraints slength tlength slength maxCost consist only lowercase English letters
