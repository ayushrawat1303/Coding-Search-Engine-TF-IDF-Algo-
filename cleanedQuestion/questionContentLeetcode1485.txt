Parallel Courses III You given integer which indicates there courses labeled from You also given integer array relations where relations denotes course prevCoursej has be completed before course nextCoursej prerequisite relationship Furthermore you given indexed integer array time where time denotes how many months it takes complete ith course You must find minimum number months needed complete all courses following these rules You may start taking course any time if prerequisites met Any number courses can be taken same time Return minimum number months needed complete all courses Note test cases generated such it possible complete every course ie graph directed acyclic graph Example Input relations time Output Explanation figure above represents given graph time required complete each course We start course course simultaneously month Course takes months course takes months complete respectively Thus earliest time we can start course month total time required months Example Input relations time Output Explanation figure above represents given graph time required complete each course You can start courses month You can complete them after months respectively Course can be taken only after course completed ie after months It completed after months Course can be taken only after courses have been completed ie after max months Thus minimum time needed complete all courses months Constraints relationslength minn relationslength prevCoursej nextCoursej prevCoursej nextCoursej All pairs unique timelength time given graph directed acyclic graph
