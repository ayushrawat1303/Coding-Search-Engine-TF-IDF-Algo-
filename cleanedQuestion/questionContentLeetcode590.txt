Binary Gap Given positive integer find return longest distance between any two adjacent binary representation If there no two adjacent return Two adjacent if there only separating them possibly no distance between two absolute difference between their bit positions For example two have distance Example Input Output Explanation binary first adjacent pair with distance second adjacent pair with distance answer largest these two distances which Note not valid pair since there separating two underlined Example Input Output Explanation binary There not any adjacent pairs binary representation so we return Example Input Output Explanation binary Constraints
