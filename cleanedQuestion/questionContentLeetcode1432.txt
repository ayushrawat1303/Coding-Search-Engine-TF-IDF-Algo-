Minimum Total Space Wasted With Resizing Operations You currently designing dynamic array You given indexed integer array nums where nums number elements will be array time addition you given integer maximum number times you can resize array any size size array time sizet must be least nums because there needs be enough space array hold all elements space wasted time defined as sizet nums total space wasted sum space wasted across every time where numslength Return minimum total space wasted if you can resize array most times Note array can have any size start does not count towards number resizing operations Example Input nums Output Explanation size We can set initial size be total wasted space Example Input nums Output Explanation size We can set initial size be resize time total wasted space Example Input nums Output Explanation size We can set initial size resize time resize time total wasted space Constraints numslength nums numslength
