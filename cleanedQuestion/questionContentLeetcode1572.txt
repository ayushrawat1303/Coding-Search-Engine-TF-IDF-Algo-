Maximize Topmost Element After Moves You given indexed integer array nums representing contents pile where nums topmost element pile one move you can perform either following If pile not empty remove topmost element pile If there one more removed elements add any one them back onto pile This element becomes new topmost element You also given integer which denotes total number moves be made Return maximum value topmost element pile possible after exactly moves case it not possible obtain nonempty pile after moves return Example Input nums Output Explanation One ways we can end with top pile after moves as follows Step Remove topmost element pile becomes Step Remove topmost element pile becomes Step Remove topmost element pile becomes Step Add back onto pile pile becomes Note this not only way end with top pile It can be shown largest answer possible after moves Example Input nums Output Explanation first move our only option pop topmost element pile Since it not possible obtain nonempty pile after one move we return Constraints numslength nums
