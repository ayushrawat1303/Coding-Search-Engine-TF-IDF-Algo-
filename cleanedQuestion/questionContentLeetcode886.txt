Minimum Moves Reach Target with Rotations nn grid there snake spans cells starts moving from top left corner grid has empty cells represented by zeros blocked cells represented by ones snake wants reach lower right corner one move snake can Move one cell right if there no blocked cells there This move keeps horizontalvertical position snake as it Move down one cell if there no blocked cells there This move keeps horizontalvertical position snake as it Rotate clockwise if its horizontal position two cells under it both empty case snake moves from Rotate counterclockwise if its vertical position two cells its right both empty case snake moves from Return minimum number moves reach target If there no way reach target return Example Input grid Output Explanation One possible solution Example Input grid Output Constraints grid It guaranteed snake starts empty cells
