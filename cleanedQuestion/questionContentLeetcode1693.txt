Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree You given root full binary tree with following properties Leaf nodes have either value where represents False represents True Nonleaf nodes have either value where represents boolean represents boolean evaluation node as follows If node leaf node evaluation value node ie True False Otherwise evaluate nodes two children apply boolean operation its value with childrens evaluations Return boolean result evaluating root node full binary tree binary tree where each node has either children leaf node node has zero children Example Input root Output true Explanation above diagram illustrates evaluation process node evaluates False True False node evaluates True False True root node evaluates True so we return true Example Input root Output false Explanation root node leaf node it evaluates false so we return false Constraints number nodes tree range Nodeval Every node has either children Leaf nodes have value Nonleaf nodes have value
