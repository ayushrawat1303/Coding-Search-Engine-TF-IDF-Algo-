Number Bits Write function takes binary representation unsigned integer returns number bits it has also known as Hamming weight Note Note some languages such as Java there no unsigned integer type this case input will be given as signed integer type It should not affect your implementation as integers internal binary representation same whether it signed unsigned Java compiler represents signed integers using complement notation Therefore Example input represents signed integer Example Input Output Explanation input binary string has total three bits Example Input Output Explanation input binary string has total one bit Example Input Output Explanation input binary string has total thirty one bits Constraints input must be binary string length Follow up If this function called many times how would you optimize it
