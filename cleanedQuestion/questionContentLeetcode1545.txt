Execution All Suffix Instructions Staying Grid There grid with topleft cell bottomright cell You given integer integer array startPos where startPos indicates robot initially cell startrow startcol You also given indexed string length where ith instruction for robot move left move right move up move down robot can begin executing from any ith instruction It executes instructions one by one towards end but it stops if either these conditions met next instruction will move robot off grid There no more instructions left execute Return array answer length where answer number instructions robot can execute if robot begins executing from ith instruction Example Input startPos RRDDLU Output Explanation Starting from startPos beginning execution from ith instruction th RRDDLU Only one instruction can be executed before it moves off grid st RDDLU All five instructions can be executed while it stays grid ends nd DDLU All four instructions can be executed while it stays grid ends rd DLU All three instructions can be executed while it stays grid ends th LU Only one instruction can be executed before it moves off grid th If moving up it would move off grid Example Input startPos LURD Output Explanation th LURD st URD nd RD rd Example Input startPos LRUD Output Explanation No matter which instruction robot begins execution from it would move off grid Constraints slength startPoslength startrow startcol consists
