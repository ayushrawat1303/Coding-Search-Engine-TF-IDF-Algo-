Apply Operations Array You given indexed array nums size consisting nonnegative integers You need apply operations this array where ith operation indexed you will apply following on ith element nums If nums nums then multiply nums by set nums Otherwise you skip this operation After performing all operations shift all end array For example array after shifting all its end Return resulting array Note operations applied sequentially not all once Example Input nums Output Explanation We do following operations nums nums not equal so we skip this operation nums nums equal we multiply nums by change nums array becomes nums nums not equal so we skip this operation nums nums equal we multiply nums by change nums array becomes nums nums equal we multiply nums by change nums array becomes After we shift end which gives array Example Input nums Output Explanation No operation can be applied we just shift end Constraints numslength nums
